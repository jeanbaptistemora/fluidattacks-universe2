= Differentiators

We're an Ethical Hacking and Pentesting company
offering services to identify cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
In the following table, we outline what differentiates us from our competitors:

.Comparative table
[role="tb-row"]
[cols="15,45,40"]
|====
| *Feature*
| *Fluid Attacks*
| *Others' tools*

a|==== Precision
| Our combination of technology and human expertise
ensures that all of our reported findings are vulnerabilities
– *0%* false positives (lies).
| They report about *35%* false positives.<<f1 ,*>>

a|==== Completeness
| Thanks to our combination of technology and human expertise,
we have a *0%* false negatives (omissions).
| They may reach a rate of *80%* false negatives.<<f1 ,*>>

a|==== All in one
| We provide comprehensive testing through a single solution,
including the following techniques: `SAST`, `DAST`, `IAST`, `SCA`,
Pentesting, DevSecOps, link:../../blog/fuzzy-bugs-online/[fuzzing], manual code review,
link:../../blog/reversing-mortals/[reversing] (if the source is not given), false positive elimination,
exploitation with public, private, and custom exploits, user enumeration,
password guessing and cracking, and trojan infection.
| Their standard solutions do not include all techniques.
It is common that some have to be acquired separately.

a|==== Compliance
| We validate the following standards: `OWASP`, `GDPR`,
`NERC`, `NIST`, `PCI DSS`, `HIPAA`, `ISO27002`, `CWE`, `CVE`, `EPR`,
`BSIMM9`, COMMON CRITERIA, as well as company-specific requirements.
| They validate only some of the standards mentioned.

a|==== Fast & automatic
| Our scans take minutes for deterministic vulnerabilities
and hours or days for the most critical vulnerabilities.
| Generally, their scans take minutes or hours.

a|==== Support
| Our standard service includes consulting and clarification by hackers
(via link:../../products/integrates/[Integrates]) so that users understand vulnerabilities.
| Usually, companies provide support to the users of the tools
as an additional and expensive service.

a|==== Break the build
| We break the build without false positives.
| They break the build with false positives.

a|==== Method
| Hybrid (automated tools + hands-on expert review).
| Automatic.

a|==== link:../../blog/importance-pentesting/#diagram[Correlation of attacks]
| By combining vulnerabilities A and B, we discover a new,
higher impact vulnerability C, which may compromise more registers.
| They do not achieve that correlation.

a|==== Safe mode
| We can operate in safe mode, avoiding being detected by the `SOCs`
or affecting service availability in productive environments.
| They can operate in safe mode but in a limited way, only for some checks.

a|==== Type of evidence
| Some of our most relevant evidence is (1) portions of code,
(2) images of the attack with explanatory annotations,
(3) animated `GIFs` of the attack, (4) executive reports in `PDF`,
(5) technical reports in `XLS` and `PDF`,
and (6) graphics and metrics illustrating the system's security status.
| Some of their most relevant evidence
is portions of code and executive reports.

a|==== Exploitation
| We can do exploitation as long as we have (1) an available environment
and (2) the appropriate authorization.
| There is no exploitation because they are not capable of doing `DAST`.

a|==== Management
| Through link:../../products/integrates/[Integrates], the entire security testing process is centrally managed,
the vulnerability remediation process is controlled,
permanent support is provided to the development teams,
and executive indicators for organizational management are delivered
in a simple way and in real time.
| In some companies, the tools are fragmented
and do not have a single centralized management process.

a|==== Zero-day vulnerabilities
| Our hackers are skilled at finding zero-day vulnerabilities.
| They fail to find these vulnerabilities.

a|==== Pricing
| Our cost is variable and proportional to the number of developers
building and modifying the code.
| They tend to have a fixed cost,
which is independent of the development team's size.
