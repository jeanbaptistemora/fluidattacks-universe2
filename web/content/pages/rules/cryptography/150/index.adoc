An attacker, armed with the cipher text and the encryption algorithm used,
performs an exhaustive (brute force) search on the key space to determine the
key that decrypts the cipher text to obtain the plaintext.

Verify that there is an explicit policy for management of cryptographic keys
and that a cryptographic key lifecycle follows a key management standard such
as **NIST SP 800-57**.
