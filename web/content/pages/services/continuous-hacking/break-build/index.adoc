= Break the Build in Your CI

link:../../../products/forces/[*Forces*] breaks the build in your CI,
obliging developers to fix the open vulnerabilities in order to deploy.
With just one click in link:../../../products/integrates/[*Integrates*],
managers can decide which vulnerabilities are crucial
and must break the build in their CI if they are still open.
