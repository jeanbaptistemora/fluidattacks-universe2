= Remediation

`Fluid Attacks` performs multiple finding validations.
You can check at any time if any of the findings have been closed.
To perform remediation validation:
First, you must define the treatment used to remediate the vulnerability.
Then, you must request, through link:../../../products/integrates/[*Integrates*], a finding validation.
You can always resolve any doubts by contacting `Fluid Attacks` directly.
