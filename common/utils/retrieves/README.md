# Fluid Retrieves

Fluid retrieves is an extension designed to mange the resources of
continuous hacking.

Retrieves run automatically on startup and can detect if the current file is
inside the fusion folder in the services repository. If it is in a services
retrieves repository it will be activated.

So far, Retrieves will:
    - list the groups to which the user has access
        - list the repositories of each group
          - clone repositories
