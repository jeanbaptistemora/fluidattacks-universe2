== Forces and Exploitation-Animation

[role="fw1 f-key-features lh-key-features"]
Within Integrates, Forces (Fluid Attacks' service)
displays the diagnostic script used to expose, or exploit,
a security vulnerability. This same script can also be
used to verify that your company's solution to a
particular problem has been successful. In addition,
with the Exploitation-Animation option,
a gif allows you to see
an animated representation of the process
used to exploit a vulnerability.

[role="fw1 f-key-features lh-key-features"]
The Compromised Records function within Integrates
shows your company information such as names, identifiers,
balances, products, etc., that would be vulnerable to a
security breach in a real attack. All events that inhibit
the testing can also be viewed in Integrates in real time.
