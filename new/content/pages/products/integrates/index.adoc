=== Vulnerability Prioritization and Documentation

[role="fw1 f5 lh-2"]
Integrates helps you determine which vulnerabilities
require immediate attention based on parameters
including: Age; Severity; Status (Open/Closed), and
Resolution options (Accepted/New/In
Progress/Indefinitely Accepted). After a vulnerability has
been remediated you can ask FA for documentation.

=== Forces and Exploitation-Animation

[role="fw1 f5 lh-2"]
Within Integrates, Forces (Fluid Attacks' service)
displays the diagnostic script used to expose, or exploit,
a security vulnerability. This same script can also be
used to verify that your companyâ€™s solution to a
particular problem has been successful. In addition,
with the Exploitation-Animation option, you can view
through a gif an animated representation of the process
used to exploit a vulnerability.

In Integrates, Compromised Records shows your
company information such as names, identifiers,
balances, products, etc., that would be vulnerable to a

=== Chat with Us + Email Notification

[role="fw1 f5 lh-2"]
When Drills (Fluid Attacks' service) is purchased, Fluid Attacks
will provide a private forum where your company

aspect of the project. To ensure that the client company
receives timely communication, an email notification is
also sent when a response to a client message has been

to the vulnerabilities, comments made about them, and
variations in their status.
