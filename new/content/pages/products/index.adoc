== Rules

*Rules* is a set of security requirements that allows you to parameterize a
pentest according to the risk appetite of your organization.
Rules allows you to determine what is tested and what is not,
and what is considered a vulnerability or not.
It is also the basis for determining how rigorous a pentest was,
based on tested and untested requirements.
