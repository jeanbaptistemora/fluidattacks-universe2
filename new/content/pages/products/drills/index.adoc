== Severity of Tested Requirements

[role="fw1 f-key-features lh-key-features"]
You are able to decide which security requirements will be tested on each
ethical hacking (profiling). You will know the exact severity for each hacking
(for inspected and uninspected profiled requirements).

== Vulnerabilities Management Platform

[role="fw1 f-key-features lh-key-features"]
Security analysts report findings in Integrates, the communication, monitoring
and reporting platform for projects.
You can use it to access general information about each finding,
check its remediation status, classify it according to age,
visualize real-time project statistics and progress, as well as other
functionalities.

== Remediation
{nbsp} +

[role="fw1 f-key-features lh-key-features"]
Multiple finding validation cycles are performed
during the subscription period.
You can check if any findings have been successfully closed
as many times as you require.
In order to perform this remediation validation, you must first define
the treatment used to remediate the vulnerability and then request,
through Integrates, a finding validation.
You can request clarification on any issue
by directly contacting Fluid Attacks' hackers also through Integrates.

== Healthcheck

{nbsp} +

[role="fw1 f-key-features lh-key-features"]
All versions of existing code should be attacked up to the subscription start
point, in addition to the monthly test limit.
A healthcheck is intended to catch
up with the development team within the first *3* months of subscription.
Then the continuous hacking advances simultaneously with the development.

== Critical Information Extraction and Information Removal

[role="fw1 f-key-features lh-key-features"]
Whenever findings indicate the need to obtain information, the extraction is
done to maximize finding impacts without compromising sensitive information.
*7* days after a customer approves their final report all information gathered
during ethical hacking is deleted securely from all *Fluid Attacksâ€™* systems.
