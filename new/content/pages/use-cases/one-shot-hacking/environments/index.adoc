= Severity and Testing Environments

For every hacking process, you can be aware of its severity.
Besides, you can choose all the security requirements to be tested
that you consider necessary.
Each requirement can be found and understood using link:../../../rules/[*Rules*].
Likewise, the basic hacking service
involves selecting an environment in which we would work.
If you want to test another one, that will mean an additional cost.
