= Critical Information Extraction and Information Removal

Information extraction is done to maximize the impacts of the finding.
The data gathered during a project remains on link:../../../products/integrates/[*Integrates*].
Your project's admin is allowed to delete it.
The data is removed *30* days after the admin's decision.
This operation can be reversed during those *30* days.
In that time, no user (even the admin) has access to the project's data
unless the operation is reversed.
