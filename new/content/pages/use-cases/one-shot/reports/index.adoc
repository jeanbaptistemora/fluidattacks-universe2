= Delivery of Reports, and Validation/Presentation Meetings

Final reports are all-inclusive (evidence of risks, remediation, etc.).
These are given to the clients via a safe file transfer website.
Each ethical hacking test includes a remote meeting with the technical team of
the client to verify the reports. All stakeholders in the project can take part
when there is a formal presentation of the executive report.
