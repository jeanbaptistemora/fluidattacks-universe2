= Coverage

Ethical hacking can be done to achieve specific, full or variable coverage.
Specific coverage refers to a system where its overall size can be assessed
(application fields, lines of code, open ports) and you choose to cover only a
specific percentage. When you choose to cover the entire system, that's full
coverage. Variable coverage, otherwise, refers to a system where its overall
size cannot be assessed and a specific scope is predefined.
