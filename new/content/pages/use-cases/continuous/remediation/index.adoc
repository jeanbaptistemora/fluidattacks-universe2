= Remediation

Multiple finding validation cycles are done during the subscription period.
You can check at any time if any of the findings have been closed.
To perform remediation validation: First, you must define the treatment used to
remediate the vulnerability. Then, you must request, through Integrates,
a finding validation. You can always solve any doubt by contacting
Fluid Attacks directly.
