= Remediation

Multiple finding validation cycles are performed during the subscription period.
You can check if any findings have been successfully closed as many times as you
require. In order to perform this remediation validation,
you must first define the treatment used to remediate the vulnerability
and then request, through *Fixes*, a finding validation.
You can request clarification on any issue by directly contacting
Fluid Attacksâ€™ hackers also through *Fixes*.
