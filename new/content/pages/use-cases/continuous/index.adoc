= Continuous Hacking

== Report of Vulnerabilities at DevOps Speed

We detect and report all the vulnerabilities and security issues during +
the whole software development cycle. +
With this method, we detect security issues continuously as software +
evolves. +
The inspection is done without false positives and ensures previous +
issues were resolved before going to production.
