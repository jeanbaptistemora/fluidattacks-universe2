= Hacking Techniques, Team, Duration and Cycles

Integral continuous hacking, performed with manual testing and use of tools,
is achieved through ethical hacking of applications and infrastructure,
along with source code analysis. Fluid Attacks detects Zero Day findings with no
false positive reports.
To perform the testing, Fluid Attacks, with its certified security experts,
requires access to the GIT repository and the integration environment.
The minimum subscription time for continuous hacking is one year,
and the selected system is attacked multiple times to test all versions
generated during the development phase.
