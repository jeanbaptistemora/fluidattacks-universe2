= Severity and Testing Environments

You are able to decide which security requirements will be tested on each
ethical hacking (profiling) through Rules. You will know the exact severity for
each hacking (for inspected and uninspected profiled requirements).
Basic service allows you to choose a single environment from production,
testing or integration. You can also add additional testing environments
for validation at an additional charge.
