= Severity and Testing Environments

You can decide through *Rules* which security requirements will be tested.
You can know the exact severity of each hacking
(for inspected and uninspected profiled requirements).
Basic service allows you to choose a single production, testing, or integration
environment. You can also add another one for validation at an extra charge.
