= Continuous Hacking

== Report of Vulnerabilities at High Speed

We detect and report all vulnerabilities and security issues
during the whole software development life cycle.
With this method, we perform comprehensive testing,
detecting security issues continuously as software evolves.
The inspection is done without false positives
and ensures previous issues were resolved before going to production.
