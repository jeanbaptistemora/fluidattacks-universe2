= Critical Information Extraction and Information Removal

Information extraction is done to maximize the impacts of the finding.
The data gathered during a subscription remains on link:../../../products/integrates/[*Integrates*].
Your subscription's admin is allowed to delete it.
The data is removed *30* days after the admin's decision. This operation can be
reversed during those *30* days.
In that time, no user (even the admin) has access to the group's data unless
the operation is reversed.
