= Hacking Techniques, Team, Duration and Cycles

Continuous hacking means automatic and manual testing.
It is done through the ethical hacking of the apps, the infrastructure,
and the source code.
*Fluid Attacks* makes Zero-Day findings and does not report false positives.
The testing needs access to the *GIT* repository and the
integration environment. The selected system is attacked again and again
to test all the versions created before.
