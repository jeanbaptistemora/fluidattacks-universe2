= R327. Set a rate limit

== Requirement

The server must have a rate limit to control interaction frequency.

== Description

Several attacks depend on executing a huge amount of requests from a single
host.
For instance, it is possible to exhaust a server's connection pool with a
single machine by using asynchronous requests,
effectively causing a Denial of Service (*DoS*).
These and other attacks such as the ones depending on brute force
can be thwarted, or severely hindered, by limiting the number of requests that
a single host can send to the server in a short period of time.
Therefore, server settings should include a rate limit that considers a regular
request flow between a host and the server.

In this attack, the adversary tries every possible value for a password until
they succeed.
A brute force attack, if feasible computationally, will always be successful
because it will essentially go through all possible passwords given the
alphabet used (lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, symbols, etc.)
and the maximum length of the password.

The software allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of
an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources
that can be allocated,
in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.

that it has with an actor,
such as the number of incoming requests.

V2.2 General Authenticator Requirements.(2.2.1)]
Verify that anti-automation controls are effective at mitigating breached
credential testing, brute force, and account lockout attacks.
Such controls include blocking the most common breached passwords,
soft lockouts, rate limiting, CAPTCHA, ever increasing delays between attempts,
IP address restrictions,
or risk-based restrictions such as location, first login on a device,
recent attempts to unlock the account, or similar.
Verify that no more than 100 failed attempts per hour is possible on a single
account.
