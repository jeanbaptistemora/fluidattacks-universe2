= R317. Allow erasure requests

== Requirement

The system must allow users to request erasure of data belonging to them
that it is managing.

== Description

Systems usually request information from the users,
obtain it from third parties or collect it based on their interactions with the
application.
They should have a mechanism that allows users to request the erasure of this
information and guarantees its complete deletion.
Furthermore, the erasure should also occur if the user decides to revoke their
consent.

identify the users based on the information collected from them,
this requirement is not applicable.
