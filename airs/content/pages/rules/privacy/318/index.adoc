= R318. Notify third parties of changes

== Requirement

The system must notify third parties
when it rectifies or erases shared personal information.

== Description

Systems usually request information from the users,
obtain it from third parties or collect it based on their interactions with the
application.
They sometimes share personal information with third parties after having
requested consent from its owner.
Whenever this information will be rectified or erased upon request from its
owner,
the system must notify said third parties so that they may do the same.
This is also the case when the user requests that the system stop processing
their data.

== Exceptions

. The system must proceed with the notification unless it is impossible or
involves disproportionate effort.

. The processing of the personal information might have archiving purposes
in the public interest.
If the system properly safeguards this information and if complying with this
requirement seriously impairs those purposes,
this requirement is not applicable.
