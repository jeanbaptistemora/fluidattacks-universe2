= Offensive Security Exploit Developer (OSED)

`OSED` is an exploit development certification,
created by `Offensive Security` (`OffSec`).
It is one of three certifications making up the new
`OSCE3` certification,
along with the `OSWE` for web application security
and the `OSEP` for penetration testing. +
In an intense 48-hour exam,
the professionals prove they can find bugs in a binary application
and build an exploit from scratch,
craft exploits for common security mitigations and
use the technique to bypass data execution prevention.
