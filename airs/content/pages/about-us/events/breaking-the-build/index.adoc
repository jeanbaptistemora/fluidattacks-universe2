= Breaking the Build

== 1. Objective

The term `SecDevOps` has grown in popularity in recent years.
However, Webinars addressing this topic
tend to only focus on its benefits, or possible use cases,
ignoring people’s main motivation to attend this kind of event.

It is fairly safe to assume that people want to also find out
*how this works* and *where to start*.
Many speakers demonstrate how to perform tests
over an extremely simple environment,
completely unrelatable to our everyday tasks,
and in this case, new questions emerge, such as:
*Does this work?* Or, *how can I apply this to my company?*

Based on the above, in this talk,
we seek to answer the posed questions
by sharing the methodologies and work practices, or *habits*,
that allow us to implement a `SecDevOps` culture
in the execution of our projects;
from the infrastructure management to the development of our orchestration platform
for vulnerability remediation: Integrates.

These habits allow us not only to increase our productivity,
and generate value for our customers on a daily basis,
but also to increase the security of our production deployments.
Thereby, we have been able to reach the following average rates:

== 2. Content

This *seminar/workshop* aims to implement
the concepts and techniques
covered in link:../burn-the-datacenter/[Burn the Datacenter].
Everything is performed *live*
over real infrastructure and applications,
giving the audience a look into the backstage of the process:
The tools used, the logs that allow us to identify issues,
and even the source code that defines each step
for the correct deployment of our applications,
always focusing on how our infrastructure and products
are updated in *real time*.

To help understand how everything happens
and demonstrate how to take the first step to reach this configuration,
we also explain all the work habits
that have allowed us to reach this point and keep improving daily.
These include topics such as:

* Source code management inside repositories,
following a *monorepo* structure
(say goodbye to multirepo)

* Keep a clean and small environment for the developers,
including the changes to the master branch,
avoiding code accumulation
and reaching *zero inventory* (leaving `gitflow` behind)

* Generate daily value to the customers
through a *micro changes* methodology
(instead of big changes every `3` weeks or more).

* Migrate and manage all the infrastructure as versioned source code,
turning it into *immutable infrastructure*
(avoiding management consoles and unauthorized changes).

* Define Continuous Integration environments as source code,
`*pipeline as code*`, in a way that can easily be configured
and modified for all kinds of tests
(avoiding graphical interface limitations for pipeline configurations).

* Avoid servers at any cost, migrating to cloud services
and reaching a *serverless* infrastructure.

* Safe password management when deploying an application,
avoiding sensitive information disclosure in source code
and *keeping the secrets protected*.

* Deploy *ephemeral environments* that allow testing
all the developed features before passing to production
(reducing project complexity by avoiding development environments,
testing, `QA`, and others).

* *Breaking the build* even before making a `commit` to the repository
using `*pre-commit*` to check the source code.

* Perform tests over the source code and over the deployment
that *break the build* as a result of the smallest error
(instead of only notifying and allowing the error to keep evolving/growing):

** Multiplatform integration
** Unit testing
** Coverage
** Strict `Linters`
** `Security Gates (SAST y DAST)`

* Extreme reduction of `build` times
by using the *cache* correctly.

*  Take advantage of the features presented
in the version control client `Git`:

** `Peer Review`
** `Squashing`
** `Rebasing`
** `Rollback`
** `Trigger builds`

* *Telemetry* accessible to developers
(not logs, only available for infrastructure area).

Each above-mentioned point is explained
while accessing `Fluid Attacks'` systems
to look at its implementation and operation.
According to the needs or interest of the participants,
it is possible to focus on the topics they deem most important.

== 4. Where?

The presentation can be hosted
at your company's facilities or an external venue.
