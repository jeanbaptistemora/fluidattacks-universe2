= Live Hacking

== 1. Objective

Have you ever wondered how safe the applications you use everyday are?
Those that have access to your personal
and, in some cases, financial information?
Are these applications so safe that the only ones
that might be able to compromise them
are the kind of `hackers` that you see on TV and in movies,
those who sit in front of a black screen with green letters,
use the keyboard at lightning speed,
and probably speak binary as their second language?

We are sorry to burst your bubble, but the truth is far from that,
and it probably takes a much less extraordinary person
to compromise your information.
This is usually because the most common vulnerabilities
found in applications are of the type
`_XSS (Cross Site Scripting)_`, `_SQLi (SQL Injections)_`,
`_CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)_`, _Insecure Session Management_
and _Insecure Configurations_, among others.
These vulnerabilities are widely documented,
and their exploitation can be, in some cases, extremely simple,
even without requiring an in-depth knowledge
of computation or programming.

We give you a look at how our `ethical hackers`
exploit these vulnerabilities to obtain sensitive information,
hijack a session, or even gain root access
over the server running the application.

== 2. Content

In this conference, we will use an application named
link:http://www.itsecgames.com/[bWAPP],
which has the particularity of being vulnerable by design (`vbd`).
This allows `ethical hackers` and security enthusiasts
to practice their skills and keep improving,
while those who are just starting in this world
can also learn how to find and exploit vulnerabilities.

The application will be attacked from different levels:
the web interface and the different services
running inside the server.
We start with an identification phase,
followed by the exploitation and privilege escalation.

We will also show the programming issues
that cause these vulnerabilities,
always keeping it simple,
so all participants, no matter their profession,
can keep up and understand the importance of information security
in a world where applications and devices are multiplying exponentially.

== 3. Experience

This conference was held in the Information Security Workshop
carried out by link:https://www.tigo.com.co/[`TigoUne`].

== 4. Where?

The presentation can be hosted
at your company's facilities or an external venue.

The talk can be given in Medell√≠n with a minimum audience of `10`.
For other cities in Colombia and Latin America,
the minimum is `20` participants.

== 5. Duration

The event duration is `1` hour.

== 6. Audience

This conference is suitable for people with basic or low technical knowledge.
The audience limit is `30` participants.

== 7. Speakers
