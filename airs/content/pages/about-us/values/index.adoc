Following are some examples of how our values and principles
operate in our business interactions with customers:

No detected vulnerabilities are stored
for future personal or organizational use.

. *Attacks are only carried out with authorization from the client
and in personal test environments
or environments created to be hacked (CTFs, challenge sites, etc.)*.
Attacks are not carried out as a test, outside of work hours,
or outside of the organization
to third parties (partners, other companies, friends, etc.).

. *The vulnerabilities found by the hacker are not revealed:*
Detected vulnerabilities are only revealed to the client
and authorized people working directly on the project.
Hackers do not reveal any information regarding vulnerabilities,
nor their existence, to any unauthorized person
inside or outside of `Fluid Attacks`.

. *Any infection installed for an attack is uninstalled:*
After finishing a client's project
all the software installed to infect the system is completely removed.
If this is not possible, the client is notified in writing
regarding the details of this situation.

. *All detected security issues are reported:*
If we know a security issue exists,
it is reported in writing to the client.

If `Fluid Attacks` discovers any errors, or missteps,
on our part during work on your project, we will inform you,
take full responsibility for any impacts and repercussions,
and do whatever is required to fix them.
