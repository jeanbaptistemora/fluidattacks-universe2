:definition: Fluid Attacks acknowledges many companies' alarming situation today that considerably increase their attack surfaces as they implement multiple digital solutions that keep them in competition. An ‘attack surface’ includes all your own and third-party hardware and software connected to the Internet that stores and handles your company's data. This entire collection of digital assets may contain security flaws or vulnerabilities at risk of being exploited by cybercriminals. Fluid Attacks provides you with an Attack Surface Management (ASM) program. It is linked to our Continuous Hacking service to comprehensively evaluate your networks for potential risks and continually identify security vulnerabilities that need remediation. Fluid Attacks' ASM can help your company understand its exposure and reduce the corresponding attack surface.
:defaux: In general terms, the ASM has an initial step that involves discovering all your internet-facing digital assets (e.g., web apps, cloud, mobile apps, IoT, email servers) that use some of your corporate data. Afterward, it is necessary to classify these assets based on characteristics such as functionality and business criticality. Next, with security ratings or risk assessments and analytics for all digital assets, we prioritize some of them when looking for vulnerabilities through ethical hacking. As a last but simultaneously all-pervasive step, it is crucial to have continuous security monitoring of internal and external network environments and systems, updated on old and new vulnerabilities and threats—even considering malicious assets.

= Attack Surface Management

=== Digital asset identification

Continuous monitoring in an ASM program provides your company
with a holistic perception of the digital assets existing on your
internal and external networks and the potential attack vectors
for malicious hackers.

=== Improved security testing

ASM programs are a key to successful ethical hacking activities
in your network environments because, in addition to knowing
all the systems involved, it is possible to classify and
prioritize them for evaluation.

=== Reduced cybersecurity risks

Discovering, monitoring, and managing your company's digital
assets can help prevent the presence of outdated and unknown
software and components. It can also help reduce human mistakes
or misconfigurations, data breaches, and more attackers'
possibilities to jeopardize your firm.
