:definition: Fluid Attacks’ Software Composition Analysis (SCA) reduces cybersecurity risks related to open source or third-party components, which are so sought after by development teams nowadays. SCA scans generate and deliver inventory reports of all direct and indirect open source components used by your analyzed software. They then provide information on component licenses, versions and security vulnerabilities present. Through an SCA combining automatic and manual work, we are always ready to detect new vulnerabilities; we do not depend exclusively on what is known and available in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) for open source vulnerabilities. Additionally, our team of hackers working with the SCA technique has no problem covering almost any coding language used in your company for application development.

= SCA

=== Discovering your open source

The use of open source components in software projects is currently increasing.
Being aware of which of those components are being used within your apps, how
up-to-date they are, and what security flaws they contain can be quite useful in
avoiding future breaches and attacks.

=== Unaffected DevOps speed

Fluid Attacks’ SCA can be easily integrated into your CI/CD pipelines anywhere
in your SDLC to promptly and continuously deliver useful information to your
developers, including specific vulnerability locations, without affecting your
company’s DevOps speed.

=== An element of a comprehensive test

The SCA technique can be complemented by other techniques used in Fluid Attacks,
such as DAST, SAST, IAST, SRE, and Manual Pentesting, to constitute a
comprehensive application security testing. This way, we guarantee zero false
positives and low rates of false negatives in your software’s assessments.
