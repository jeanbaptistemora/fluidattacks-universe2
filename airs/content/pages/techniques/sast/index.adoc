:definition: Fluid Attacks’ Static Application Security Testing (SAST) detects security vulnerabilities in your applications. You don’t have to wait until they are built and in production to start evaluating them. Our assessments and analyses are supported by Skims, our automatic tool, which provides feedback to developers, searching for vulnerabilities with easy, precise, and fast execution across your entire SDLC. However, it is our ethical hackers who carry the main responsibility of completing a more in-depth attack on your IT systems without compromising your company’s development pace. This form of white-box testing is available for diverse frameworks and languages, and examines in line with multiple industry standards. It aims to reduce risks and costs through the early detection of weaknesses in a non-running software and seamless integration into your CI pipelines.

= SAST

=== Quick vulnerability detection

The fast and early detection of security flaws can accelerate the remediation
processes and achieve significant money and time savings for your company.

=== No false positives

The low rates of false positives appearing on Skims’ automatic scans can be
brought to zero after thorough manual checks by our certified team of ethical
hackers.

=== Scanning based on standards

Scans performed through Fluid Attacks’ SAST are based on many of the current
industry standards and requirements (e.g., OWASP, NIST, PCI DSS, GDPR, HIPAA,
CWE, NERC, CAPEC). SAST provides quick and detailed reports of any
non-compliance in your applications for appropriate intervention.

=== Low rates of false negatives

A SAST technique performed both automatically and manually allows us to
guarantee low rates of false negatives, contrary to what can be achieved by
companies that depend exclusively on tools.

=== An element of a comprehensive test

The SAST technique can be complemented by other methods used in Fluid Attacks,
such as DAST, IAST, SCA, SRE, and Manual Pentesting, to constitute a
comprehensive application security testing.
