:page-solution: Simulating an attack scenario can be the best way to discover whether an organization’s information system and defense staff are ready to identify, respond to, and prevent real threats. Current malicious hackers and malware follow specific procedures which our certified team of ethical hackers has the ability to understand and implement in every controlled simulation. Through this solution, in which our team strictly assumes the role of the attacker, you will find out what the weaknesses of your company are in terms of cybersecurity, and consequently achieve the first step to strengthening your IT systems’ controls and enhancing their security.

= Attack Simulation

=== Close to reality

The ethical hacker uses simulated attacks to bring your company closer to the
reality of potential cybersecurity problems. Their work and findings can
motivate you to make the necessary modifications to your systems in order to
anticipate malicious hackers’ actions.

=== Exploitation

We can do exploitation as long as we have an open environment and your
authorization. After discovering a vulnerability and exploiting it, we can show
you the impacts on compromised records such as users, passwords, wages, credit
card numbers, files on a hard disk, etc.

=== Severity of vulnerabilities

A simulated attack allows us to know your systems’ vulnerabilities and classify
them according to their severity (critical ones tend to receive a high
priority). With the information we provide, you can consider the possible
impacts of each vulnerability on your business and make the necessary decisions
in order to keep your company secure.
