:solution: We offer the integration of security into the development + operations (DevOps) methodology during Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). In DevSecOps, all team members involved in software development become responsible for security. As opposed to other companies’ approach, at Fluid Attacks, we are not entirely dependent on tools and place more value on our ethical hackers’ skills to ensure greater accuracy in testing. We recognize that speed without precision is useless. Our security solutions can help optimize your development process from the first uploaded commit and continue after the application is in production.

= DevSecOps

=== Optimal integration

Our security testing, integrating techniques such as SAST, DAST, IAST and SCA,
supports your whole software development process while ensuring smooth
communication between our red team and your developers.

=== Manual and precise work

At Fluid Attacks, our hackers go beyond using automated tools, using their
expertise to discover everything that can pose a cybersecurity risk within your
IT systems. This allows us to guarantee zero false positives and zero false
negatives in our projects.

=== Legacy languages and methods

We hack legacy applications coded in old-established languages, including COBOL,
RPG, PL1 and TAL. In addition, we integrate with any development method such as
Waterfall, Agile and DevOps.

=== Early detection

Confirmed vulnerabilities in the code are quickly identified at early
development stages. This is because our continuous hacking advances
simultaneously with the developers’ work.

=== High remediation rates

At Fluid Attacks, we help you ensure high vulnerability remediation rates in
your IT systems. By breaking the build in the continuous integration pipeline,
we can encourage you to quickly repair those weaknesses that can generate severe
impacts on your business.

=== Break the build

At Fluid Attacks, we have *Forces* to break the build.
Within our DevSecOps solution, we can break the build
in any continuous integration pipeline
without making the mistake of doing so with false positives or lies.
