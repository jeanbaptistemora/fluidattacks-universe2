= SCADA and OT

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
Operational Technology (OT) contrasts with Information Technology (IT) because,
although both use hardware and software, the former monitors the industrial
physical processes, equipment and infrastructure, while the latter controls the
storage and data flow. OT is related to industrial control systems (ICS), among
which we find supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems as one of
the most commonly used.

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
It is in these types of systems, which collect data from sensors and send it to
central systems, that we perform security testing at Fluid Attacks, considering
the possible risks that your company may face related to the connection between
OT and IT networks with the Internet. The OT security testing by our ethical
hackers involves mainly the DAST and the Manual Pentesting techniques. Our
network and system assessments can be critical in preventing malicious hackers
from impacting OT environments and jeopardizing not only industrial
organizations’ productivity and efficacy but also, and more importantly,
workers’ and perhaps even customers’ safety.
