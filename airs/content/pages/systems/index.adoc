= Systems

== Web Applications
We can help you test your web applications' features, functions and components
which may possess security vulnerabilities that put your company's and users'
information assets at risk. Our security testing goes beyond the OWASP top
ten web application security risks. +
[button]#link:web-apps/[Go to Web Applications {arrow}]#

== Mobile Applications
We stay up to date with attack vectors on mobile applications and provide you
with security testing to identify vulnerabilities in this type of system.
We work with iOS, Android and Windows UI, and go beyond the OWASP top 10
mobile vulnerabilities and other popular lists. +

== Thick Clients
We recognize the value of assessing not only thin client but also
thick client applications, which mainly operate on the client-side
with or without a connection to a network.
Testing configurations and interactions,
we look for vulnerabilities that affect both the client and the server-side. +

== APIs and Microservices
We are aware of the essential functions of APIs and microservices
in the applications and how both can be vulnerable to cyberattacks.
We evaluate microservices' interactions and operations,
as well as the exposition of APIs in order to detect vulnerabilities
which could be exploited by criminals. +

== Cloud Infrastructure
We can help you test the cloud infrastructure your company has acquired
for its monetary and optimization benefits.
We work on Azure, AWS, GCP or any other cloud
to identify configuration, application or network weaknesses
representing potential attack vectors. +
[button]#link:cloud-infrastructure/[Go to Cloud Infrastructure {arrow}]#

== Networks and Hosts
We are able to perform assessments of hosts, devices and services
of your company's internal and external networks. We can help you detect
misconfigurations and outdated components, among other flaws, going from
general structure analysis to specific element inspection. +

== Internet of Things
We understand that IoT devices are often implemented in some companies'
infrastructures without the appropriate security measures. We provide
you with security testing for each connected element and every new
incorporation to find vulnerabilities that may affect other devices or servers. +

== SCADA and OT
We also work on Operational Technology that serves for the monitoring of industrial
elements and processes. We implement security assessments in the
industrial control system SCADA, considering the cybersecurity risks
your company may face when OT networks are connected to the Internet. +
