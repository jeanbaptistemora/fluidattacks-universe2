= Disclosure Policy

_This document was last updated on May 3, 2021_

This disclosure policy ("Policy") describes how `Fluid Attacks`
("Fluid Attacks", "we", "us" or "our")
discloses third-party product vulnerabilities found by our Offensive Team.

This Policy does not apply to vulnerabilities found
for customers as part of the link:../../services/continuous-hacking[Continuous Hacking]
and link:../../services/one-shot-hacking[One-Shot Hacking] services,
unless there is explicit approval,
as they are covered by a Non-Disclosure Agreement.

== Goal

`Fluid Attacks'` commitment is to find all vulnerabilities
and report them as soon as possible.
In order to accomplish this, we adhere to the
link:https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html[ISO/IEC 29147:2018] and
link:https://www.iso.org/standard/69725.html[ISO/IEC 30111:2019]
standards, which describes the accepted responsible disclosure and
vulnerability handling guidelines to ensure the maximum benefit
for vendors, customers and the community in general. This includes:

* Providing the maximum level of detail on the vulnerabilities found
in a way that the vendors are able to reproduce the problem.
* Ensuring coordinated disclosure of the vulnerabilities
with the affected vendors, minimizing the damage
that can occur with early disclosures.
* Releasing the details of the vulnerabilities on our link:../[Advisories] page,
including a risk level score using link:https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1[CVSS v3.1] and proof of concept artifacts.

This leads to an overall risk reduction for the users.

== Scope

`Fluid Attacks` will apply this Policy
to disclose third-party product vulnerabilities to whom we will issue
CVE IDs and that are not in the scope
of another CNA (CVE Numbering Authority).

The vulnerability types that we would process are the ones defined in our
link:https://docs.fluidattacks.com/types/[findings classification].
However, vulnerabilities that don't fit on this classification will
be also reviewed if there is an evidenced risk.

== Disclosure process

`Fluid Attacks` is always looking for vulnerabilities.
Once our team finds a new unpublished vulnerability,
we will proceed as follows:

1. An initial report is created with all the details of the vulnerability
and with any applicable proof of concept.
1. If the vulnerability is found through our link:../../services/continuous-hacking[Continuous Hacking]
or link:../../services/one-shot-hacking[One-Shot Hacking] services,
it will be reported only to the affected customer
via our Attack Surface Manager (ASM).
1. If the vulnerability is found by our Research Team on a third-party product,
the report will be sent to the affected vendor.
1. A new advisory draft is created on our link:../[Advisories] page
containing only the product affected, the report's current status
and the timeline. We will update it at each relevant event
around the vulnerability (vendor reply, patch availability,
proof of concept availability, on-wild exploitation indicators, etc.).
1. We will wait up to five (5) days for the vendor to acknowledge the report.
If there is no response in that time,
we will proceed with our link:#Responsible_disclosure[Responsible Disclosure] process.
1. If the vendor acknowledges the report
but there are no updates on the issue after fifteen (15) days,
we will proceed with our link:#Responsible_disclosure[Responsible Disclosure] process.
1. Otherwise, we can arrange
a coordinated vulnerability disclosure with the vendor.
We suggest this to be done
in no more than ninety (90) days after the discovery.

`Fluid Attacks` also reserves the right
to disclose the vulnerability at any time
in cases where early disclosure would provide benefits to stakeholders.

== Responsible disclosure

Vulnerability disclosure is performed
according to the parameters described above.
The process is as follows:

1. The advisory draft on link:../[Advisories]
will be updated with the details of the vulnerability
and any relevant proof of concept.
1. If necessary, a new CVE will be issued.
1. The advisory will be published to relevant public email lists,
social media or link:../../blog/[blog] posts.
