:description: Our One-Shot Hacking service reports security vulnerabilities in specific versions of your applications.
:keywords: Fluid Attacks, Services, Ethical Hacking, Security, Application, Vulnerabilities, One-Shot Hacking, Pentesting
:template: services/one-shot
:definition: We detect and report all vulnerability and security issues within one specific version of your application. The rigorous inspection carried out by our team allows us to detect all existing security issues with very low rates of false positives.

= One-Shot Hacking

=== Coverage

Ethical hacking can be done to achieve specific, full or variable coverage.
Specific coverage refers to a system where its overall size can be assessed
(application fields, lines of code, open ports)
and you choose to cover only a specific percentage.
When you choose to cover the entire system, that is full coverage.
Variable coverage refers to a system
where its overall size cannot be assessed and a specific scope is predefined.

=== Critical Information Extraction and Information Removal

Information extraction is done to maximize the impacts of the findings.
The data gathered during a project
remains on our *Attack Surface Manager (ASM)*.
Your project's admin is allowed to delete it.
The data is removed *30* days after the admin's decision.
This operation can be reversed during those *30* days.
In that time, no user (even the admin) has access to the project's data
unless the operation is reversed.

=== Severity of Tested Requirements

For every hacking process, you can be aware of its severity.
Besides, you can choose all the security requirements to be tested
that you consider necessary.
Each requirement can be found and understood using
link:../../../products/rules/list[*Rules*].

=== Hacking Techniques, Team, Duration and Cycle

It is possible to perform ethical hacking of the source code, the application or
the infrastructure. You can choose the hacking technique that best suits the
needs of your business to meet the required security assessment of each system.
One-shot hacking, performed with manual testing and use of tools by
Fluid Attacksâ€™ certified hackers, seeks to attack a single version of your
application. Therefore, it has only one inspection cycle on the selected system.
The duration depends on the size of the *ToE* attack surface.
Once all the requirements for starting the project have been met,
each attack will have a defined start and end date.

=== Infection

Whenever findings allow it, the infrastructure is infected with malicious files.
This process is carried out to gain extra data, infect servers,
and verify network controls.
We use *Shells* and cyber-weapons with the prior authorization of the client.

=== Delivery of Reports and Validation / Presentation Meetings

Final reports are all-inclusive (evidence of risks, remediation, etc.).
These are given to the clients via a safe file transfer website.
Each ethical hacking test includes a remote meeting with the technical team of
the client to verify the reports. All stakeholders in the project can take part
when there is a formal presentation of the executive report.

=== Attack Surface Manager

You can check the status of findings
during the execution of the project using *ASM*.
Each project must have a leader
so that he or she can express the needs of your company
before, during, and after the performance.
Daily progress reports are sent by email. These include coverage, strictness,
partial results, and overall progress.
