:page-definition: Fluid Attacks’ Reverse Engineering (RE) is an outside-in process of deconstructing software, performed by our certified, experienced hackers. They employ this technique, which goes from an overview to an in-depth observation, to analyze and obtain knowledge about your applications’ flaws or vulnerabilities. Although they need to use disassemblers, debuggers and decompilers, this complicated process relies mostly on their skills and creativity. It cannot merely be done by automated tools. RE usually starts with static methods to recognize components, functions and other basic information, and finishes with dynamic ones (using techniques like sandboxing and symbolic execution), more oriented towards focused experimentation to confirm/discard software operation hypotheses. All this can help our hackers understand how difficult it is to hack into your applications or systems and then develop more elaborate attacks to report your cybersecurity weaknesses.

= RE

=== Manual and accurate testing

This technique is highly useful for teams committed to their company’s security.
They have recognized that relying on automated tools for IT systems’ assessments
is not the best option, considering the high rates of false positives
that may be involved.

=== What happens inside

RE helps to reveal the innermost details and components of your applications or
systems, as well as their interactions, to recognize patterns and determine if
they pose any cybersecurity risk for your company.

=== When there is no source code

Through this technique, an application can be evaluated in depth, especially in
cases where, for some particular reason, its source code is not available to our
ethical hackers.

=== An element of a comprehensive test

The RE technique can be complemented by other techniques used in Fluid Attacks,
such as DAST, SAST, IAST and SCA, to constitute a comprehensive application
security testing. This way, we guarantee minimal rates of false positives
and false negatives in your software’s assessments.
