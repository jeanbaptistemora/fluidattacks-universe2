:page-definition: Fluid Attacks is happy to offer you the widespread Penetration Testing as a Service (PTaaS) model to address your cybersecurity needs in an ever-changing attack vectors environment. For your convenience, it is supported by our Attack Surface Manager (ASM). Additionally, it is connected to our leading Continuous Hacking service in order to go beyond the traditional Penetration Testing, a point-in-time evaluation. In PTaaS, we perform analyses that keep pace with the constant development and changes in your infrastructure and applications. This model provides our customers comprehensive and up-to-date information about the findings achieved in a pentest that combines world-class hackers' know-how and machines' speed. By quickly obtaining extensive details from a non-static report about the detected vulnerabilities, and after carrying out the proper prioritization, you can immediately proceed with their remediation.

= Penetration Testing as a Service

=== Deep and accurate pentesting

PTaaS does not rely only on the automation of tools and their limited results.
It also involves Fluid Attacks' certified expert analysts
for the IT systems' manual assessments,
in order to ensure that the reports display minimal rates
of false positives and false negatives.

=== Timely vulnerability reports

As part of the PTaaS, you can receive frequent, real-time updates
on the results of our red team's constant analyses via our ASM
to keep you on your toes and make the right cybersecurity decisions
for your company promptly.

=== Uninterrupted customer service

Fluid Attacks' expert penetration testing team
is at your service to evaluate different types of systems
(e.g., web apps, networks, IoT) and help you with your concerns
regarding the findings and their possible solutions.
