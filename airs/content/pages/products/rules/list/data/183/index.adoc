= R183. Delete sensitive data securely

== Requirement

The system must support the secure removal of sensitive data,
guaranteeing that it cannot be recovered.

== Description

Systems often store and delete sensitive information protected by government
regulations.
These regulations usually demand that data be removed after it is no longer
required and that its deletion follow secure procedures that prevent it
from being recovered.

Many web applications and **API**s do not properly protect sensitive data,
such as financial, healthcare, and *PII*.
Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit card
fraud, identity theft, or other crimes.
Sensitive data may be compromised without extra protection,
such as encryption at rest or in transit, and requires special precautions when
exchanged with the browser.
