= R041. Scan files for malicious code

== Requirement

the content of the files transferred to it is free of malicious code.

. [[r1]] link:http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/17.html[CAPEC-17: Using Malicious Files].
An attack of this type exploits a system's configuration that allows an
attacker to either directly access an executable file,
for example through shell access;
or in a possible worst case allows an attacker to upload a file and then
execute it.

. [[r2]] link:http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html[CAPEC-23: File Content Injection].
An attack of this type exploits the host's trust in executing remote content,
including binary files.
The files are poisoned with a malicious payload
(targeting the file systems accessible by the target software)
by the adversary and may be passed through standard channels such as via email,
and standard web content like PDF and multimedia files.

. [[r3]] link:https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/509.html[CWE-509: Replicating Malicious Code (Virus or Worm)].
Replicating malicious code, including viruses and worms, will attempt to attack
other systems once it has successfully compromised the target system or
software.

. [[r4]] link:https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/749.html[CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function].
The software provides an Applications Programming Interface (*API*) or similar
interface for interaction with external actors,
but the interface includes a dangerous method or function that is not properly
restricted.

Each Responsible Entity shall implement,
except under CIP Exceptional Circumstances,
one or more plan(s) to achieve the objective of mitigating the risk of the
introduction of malicious code to low impact BES Cyber Systems.
The plan(s) shall include antivirus software,
or other method(s) to mitigate the introduction of malicious code.

V10.1 Code Integrity Controls.(10.1.1)]
Verify that a code analysis tool is in use that can detect potentially
malicious code, such as time functions, unsafe file operations and network
connections.

Verify that files obtained from untrusted sources are scanned by antivirus
scanners to prevent upload of known malicious content.

Ensure that anti-virus programs are capable of detecting, removing, and
protecting against all known types of malicious software.
