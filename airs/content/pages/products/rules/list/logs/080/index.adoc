= R080. Prevent log modification

== Requirement

System logs must not allow modifications or alterations.

== Description

Logs are used to analyze a system's behavior.
They help detect errors and suspicious activity,
and often hold very sensitive information.
Therefore, they should be protected so that no unauthorized actor can modify
them,
since this could prevent a vulnerability or a breach from being noticed timely.

An attacker exploits characteristics of the infrastructure of a network entity
