= R326. Detect rooted devices

== Requirement

Mobile applications must check
whether the device on which they will run is rooted.

== Description

Rooting is a process that grants mobile device users privileged control over
the device's system.
Applications running on such devices are susceptible to technical information
leaks (database connection strings, source code, certificates, etc.).
Therefore, applications must check whether the device is rooted and inform the
user about the associated risks, or prevent its own execution.
