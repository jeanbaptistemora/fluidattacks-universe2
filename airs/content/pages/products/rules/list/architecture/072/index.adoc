= R072. Set maximum response time

== Requirement

The response time with the maximum expected concurrence
must be no more than 5 seconds.

== Description

Response time is a relevant measure of a system's availability and
adaptability to stress.
It is also important when it comes to usability and reliance.
For these reasons the response time must not surpass 5 seconds when the
number of concurrent users reaches its peak.

An adversary consumes the resources of a target by rapidly engaging in a large
number of interactions with the target.
This type of attack generally exposes a weakness in rate limiting or flow.
When successful this attack prevents legitimate users from accessing the
service and can cause the target to crash.

The software does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a
limited resource thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources
consumed,
eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.

The software allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of
an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources
that can be allocated,
in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.

For more advanced scenarios, query cost analysis should be used.
