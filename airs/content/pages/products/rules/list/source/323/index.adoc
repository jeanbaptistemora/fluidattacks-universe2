:rules: yes

= R323. Exclude unverifiable files

== Requirement

Binary and other types of files,
which are often not audited with security purposes,
should not be stored in the source code repository.

== Description

Binary files usually have a file size greater than their source counterpart,
which can eventually affect a repository's performance.
Changes done to them are often hard to track for versioning tools
or make no sense for a reviewer.
Furthermore, security audits on binary files are more complicated or simply
not performed,
and these could contain serious vulnerabilities such as backdoors, rootkits
and exposed sensitive information.

== Exceptions

* Image files.

== Findings

* [inner]#link:/products/rules/findings/117/[F117. Unverifiable files]#

A trapdoor is a hidden piece of code that responds to a special input,
allowing its user access to resources without passing through the normal
security enforcement mechanism.

V10.2 Malicious Code Search.(10.2.3)]
Verify that the application source code and third party libraries do not contain
backdoors,
such as hard-coded or additional undocumented accounts or keys,
code obfuscation, undocumented binary blobs, rootkits,
or anti-debugging, insecure debugging features,
or otherwise out of date, insecure, or hidden functionality that could be used
maliciously if discovered.
