=== Selection of Security Requirements

You are able to decide which security requirements will be tested
during each ethical hacking assignment: PCI, HIPAA, OWASP, NIST, GDPR.
You will know the exact severity of each hacking project
(for inspected and uninspected profiled requirements).

=== Vulnerabilities Management Platform

Findings are reported in Integrates, Fluid Attacks' platform
that allows control of the vulnerability testing and remediation processes.
You can use it to access general information about each finding,
check its remediation status, classify it according to age,
visualize real-time system statistics and progress,
as well as other functionalities.

=== Remediation

Multiple finding validation cycles are performed.
You can check if any findings have been successfully closed
as many times as you require.
In order to perform a remediation validation,
you must define the treatment used
and then proceed to request a finding validation.

=== Health Check

All versions of existing code should be attacked up
to the subscription start point, in addition to the monthly test limit.
A health check is scheduled at the beginning of the subscription
in order to catch up with the development team.
Then, the continuous hacking advances
simultaneously with the development.

=== Critical Information Extraction

Whenever findings indicate the need to obtain information,
the extraction is done to maximize finding impacts
without compromising sensitive information.
