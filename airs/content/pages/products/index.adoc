== Forces

*Forces* is a precise and very fast robot,
built to verify what is found in exact locations within the systems.
It is designed for CI and has the goal of verifying the status
(open or closed) of vulnerabilities, as well as breaking the build
to force the remediation of open vulnerabilities.
