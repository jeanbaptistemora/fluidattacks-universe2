= DevSecOps Configuration

You can use DevSeCops agent on any OS that Docker can run on.
You can also integrate DevSecOps agent into your `CI/CD` to ensure that your software
is built and shipped without previously reported vulnerabilities in our
*ASM*.

== Installation

1. Make sure you own an DevSecOps agent token. Follow this link: https://announcekit.app/dashboard/post/144137 to generate it.
2. Make sure your execution environment has the required dependencies:
** Docker
3. Install docker by following official guide:
** https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
4. Having Docker installed, pull image:
`docker pull fluidattacks/forces:new`.

== Options

* `--token`: Your DevSecOps agent token [required].
* `--dynamic / --static` Run only DAST / SAST vulnerabilities. (optional)
* `--verbose <number>`: Declare the level of detail of the report (default 3)
** `1`:It only shows the number of open, closed and accepted vulnerabilities.
** `2`: Only show open vulnerabilities.
** `3`: Show open and closed vulnerabilities.
** `4`: Show open, closed and accepted vulnerabilities.
** You can use `-v`, `-vv`, `-vvv`, `-vvvv` instead of `--verbose`.
* `--strict / --lax`: Run forces in strict mode (default `--lax`).
* `--repo-path`: Git repository path (optional)

== Examples

Run the Docker image:

1. To check `all` vulnerabilities including static and dynamic
** `docker run --rm fluidattacks/forces:new forces --token <your-token>`.
2. To check only `static` vulnerabilities
** `docker run --rm fluidattacks/forces:new forces --static --strict --token <your-token>`.
3. To check only `dynamyc` vulnerabilities
** `docker run --rm fluidattacks/forces:new forces --dynamic --strict --token <your-token>`.
