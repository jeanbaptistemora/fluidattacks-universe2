= F084. MDNS spoofing

== Description

The configuration of the mDNS services allows an attacker to spoof IP
addresses,
effectively hijacking them or causing a denial-of-service.
Alternatively, due to a lack of certain security measures,
it is possible to intercept requests to mDNS services and obtain
information about the connected devices.
