= F024. Unrestricted access between network segments

== Description

The system's network configuration does not properly limit access between
network segments.
This allows employees from any office to access administrative services of
servers and other offices.
Alternatively, servers that are supposed to be accessed only from an internal
network are exposed to other network segments, such as the internet.
