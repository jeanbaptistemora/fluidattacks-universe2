= CVE

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
Fluid Attacks is among the cybersecurity companies that, for findings
and reports, work and stay up to date based on CVE identifiers. Thus,
you can conveniently set a link between the information we provide
you with and many other CVE-compatible sources for the benefit of your
company's security. Additionally, Fluid Attacks' red team, with its skillful
ethical hackers dedicated to discovering zero-day vulnerabilities,
is currently part of the CVE community that feeds the CVE List.


=== What is CVE?

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
link:https://cve.mitre.org/index.html[CVE, role=basic-link] (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) is a free-to-use list of
publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. It was established in 1999
as an international dictionary with standardized identifiers for
vulnerabilities — each record has an identification number, a description
and public references. This project's main objectives were to reduce the
inconsistency between cybersecurity databases and tools (there was not
much agreement on identifying security issues) and facilitate data sharing.
Nowadays, CVE is incorporated into many products and services worldwide,
and ensures certainty among stakeholders
when communicating about vulnerabilities.
It also provides a useful baseline for evaluating and comparing tools and
services, especially with regards to their coverage.

The link:https://www.dhs.gov/[U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s, role=basic-link] (DHS)
link:https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-division[Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, role=basic-link] (CISA) sponsors CVE. On the other hand,
the American not-for-profit organization link:https://www.mitre.org/[MITRE, role=basic-link] copyrighted the CVE List to
keep it a free and open standard and legally protect its use.
CVE is not a vulnerability database but feeds the link:https://nvd.nist.gov/[NVD database, role=basic-link]
(also sponsored by CISA) and others with data on all CVE Records.
These records' IDs are like this one: link:/../../advisories/prine["CVE-2020-29659", role=basic-link] (a vulnerability
discovered by the Fluid Attacks team in 2020).
And the information shown in their descriptions may comprehend some of
these details: affected product/service, versions and vendors,
the type of vulnerability, its impact and the code or inputs involved.

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
Being a standard method for identifying vulnerabilities and exposures,
CVE does not delve into technical aspects and leaves them to the databases,
which provide extended information for every CVE Record.
CVE allows the connection of diverse elements oriented towards cybersecurity.
So, when your company, for example, hires a security testing service and
receives vulnerability reports with CVE Records, you can then access
information in other tools, services or databases (compatible with CVE)
to better understand and remediate the security issues.
