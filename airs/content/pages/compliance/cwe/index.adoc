= CWE

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
Fluid Attacks is among the cybersecurity companies recognizing the value
of and contributing to this collaborative community effort: CWE. In their
daily work, our ethical hackers, with their analysis tools, use CWE's updated
public repository of software and hardware flaws as a reference to define
their coverage and classify and label their findings. Thus, you can
conveniently set a link between the information we provide you with and many
other CWE-compatible sources for the benefit of your company's security.

=== What is CWE?

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
link:https://cwe.mitre.org/[CWE, role=basic-link] (Common Weakness Enumeration) is a community-developed, free-to-use list
or dictionary of common hardware and software weaknesses. CWE functions as
a standard language for security tools and operations that aim to identify,
eliminate and prevent weaknesses. The link:https://www.dhs.gov/[U.S. Department of Homeland Securityâ€™s, role=basic-link]
(DHS) link:https://www.dhs.gov/cisa/cybersecurity-division[Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, role=basic-link] (CISA)
sponsors this project, which is managed by the
link:https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/hssedi[Homeland Security Systems Engineering and Development Institute, role=basic-link]
(HSSEDI), which is in turn operated by link:http://www.mitre.org/[The MITRE Corporation , role=basic-link] (MITRE).
MITRE started their software weakness
categorizing efforts in 1999 and at that time created the link:https://cve.mitre.org/index.html[CVE, role=basic-link]
(Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) List. In 2005, they evaluated CVE for
use in the code assessment industry and produced the Preliminary List of
Vulnerability Examples for Researchers (PLOVER) document.
In PLOVER, the researchers succeeded in collecting known flaws in the code,
abstracting them and organizing them into common classes. Later,
they established definitions and descriptions for the groups of weaknesses,
and it was then in 2006 that the CWE List and the
associated classification taxonomy emerged.

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
In line with its website, CWE's primary objective is to provide information
to development and security teams so that they can eliminate the most common
errors in software and hardware prior to deployment.
These errors are the weaknesses, which can lead to vulnerabilities.
CWE serves as a preventive measure against the many security vulnerabilities
that have represented problems for numerous organizations worldwide.
Some of the data present in each CWE entry are the following:
identification and description of the weakness type; explanation of how the
flaw may be introduced, and the applicable platforms; the likelihood
of exploit for the weakness, and information on its consequences
and potential mitigations; code samples; related CVE IDs; references.

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
CWE has evolved over the years in line with advances in technology,
as well as enterprise concerns and needs. For this reason, for example,
CWE has been including content for mobile applications since 2014 and
support for hardware weaknesses since 2020. Thanks to the community,
the information in CWE is constantly expanding and improving.
There are also resources such as link:https://cwe.mitre.org/cwss/[CWSS, role=basic-link] and link:https://cwe.mitre.org/cwraf/[CWRAF, role=basic-link] to score the severity
of weaknesses and the link:https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/archive/2020/2020_cwe_top25.html[CWE Top 25, role=basic-link] to identify the most prevalent and
critical flaws that can lead to dangerous software vulnerabilities.
