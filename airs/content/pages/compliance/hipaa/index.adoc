== What is HIPAA?

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
The HIPAA or Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act is legislation
created by the U.S. Congress in 1996. It was enacted to regulate and improve the
flow of Protected Health Information (PHI; any data that could be used to
identify a patient) within the healthcare context to avoid fraud and theft.
This standard comprises five general rules, among which we highlight the Privacy
Rule and the Security Rule for the storage and handling of PHI by covered
entities (i.e., health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare
providers) and business associates.

The covered entities have to respond to and implement three particular
safeguards for the protection of PHI. These sets of requirements belong to the
Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 164, Subpart C - Security Standards
for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information and are
specifically the Administrative (164.308), the Physical (164.310) and the
Technical (164.312) safeguards.

Among the Administrative safeguards, we can observe requirements related to
implementing periodic reviews of information systems activity and implementing
policies to guarantee access to data by authorized personnel and procedures for
their supervision. Regarding the Physical safeguards, we can see requirements
associated with the use strategies to control and validate individuals’ access
to facilities and software and the implementation of policies for the final
disposition of electronic PHI. Finally, for Technical safeguards, among other
requirements, we can highlight the employment of unique user identifications,
the automatic logoff for predetermined times of inactivity, and the use of PHI
encryption and decryption processes.

To see all the requirements of each of the safeguards, you can follow these
links: 164.308; 164.310; 164.312.

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
Every organization storing, processing or transmitting PHI must ensure that
their security controls meet the HIPAA rules’ requirements in order to guarantee
both the availability and privacy of data. Organizations must prevent all types
of unauthorized access to their systems and PHI to avoid any security incidents
and consequently respond to penalties. Therefore, it is recommended that the
covered entities conduct regular evaluations of their security policies and
procedures to identify weaknesses and take prompt remedial action.

=== How can Fluid Attacks help with HIPAA compliance?

Ensuring compliance with up-to-date security standards may become a complicated
issue for diverse organizations that use continually evolving information
technology for their businesses. Fluid Attacks recognizes this and offers you
comprehensive testing and analysis to determine whether your company is
effectively complying with all corresponding security requirements.

Although Fluid Attacks’ Continuous Hacking service goes beyond the HIPAA,
testing around 200 technical security requirements in each of your projects,
we can guarantee the detection of all vulnerabilities in your software
associated with this standard. In addition, we provide you with reliable reports
so that your team can take the necessary steps to adjust and maintain your
information systems in line with such requirements. We allow you to avoid
penalties and, above all, guarantee secure systems for customers or users,

All our security testing is based on Rules, which is a set of security
requirements written by us in a comprehensible manner, using several
international standards as a reference. It allows you to parameterize the
assessments we make to your systems and determine what your company agrees to
comply with and what would be considered a vulnerability.
