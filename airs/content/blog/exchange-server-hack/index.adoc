= Microsoft Exchange Server Hack

The attention of global media, U.S. federal agencies,
and other organizations is partly shifting
from one world power to another this month.
I mean, in the cybersecurity field,
the Russians were in the limelight with the link:../solarwinds-attack/[SolarWinds supply chain attack].
Now, the Chinese have taken on the central role.
link:https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/02/hafnium-targeting-exchange-servers/[Microsoft has attributed attacks] on its Exchange Server
to a Chinese state-sponsored group.
These cybercriminals took advantage
of four zero-day vulnerabilities in that software
and have exploited them to break into many organizations,
primarily in the United States.
In this post, we will examine several details
that are known so far about this incident.

== What is Microsoft Exchange Server?

Microsoft Exchange Server (MES) is a link:https://services.dartmouth.edu/TDClient/1806/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=64504["software that provides] the back end
to an integrated system for email, calendaring, messaging, and tasks."
(Outlook, instead, is the app installed on your desktop that,
like other email clients, can be synchronized with MES
and used to send and receive emails.)
This program is employed worldwide within large organizations
but also small and medium-sized companies.

It turns out that in early January of this year,
the cybersecurity company link:https://www.volexity.com/blog/2021/03/02/active-exploitation-of-microsoft-exchange-zero-day-vulnerabilities/[Volexity started to note] abnormal activity
in the MES servers of two of its clients.
That activity involved large quantities of data sent to IP addresses
apparently not linked to legitimate users.
The Danish company link:https://www.dubex.dk/aktuelt/nyheder/please-leave-an-exploit-after-the-beep[Dubex also reported] part of the issue the same month.
It was not until link:https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/02/hafnium-targeting-exchange-servers/[March 2] that the situation became public:
link:https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/released-march-2021-exchange-server-security-updates/ba-p/2175901[Microsoft released updates] to remediate *four zero-day*
(previously unknown) vulnerabilities identified in its software.

== What were the alerts?

According to Microsoft, these flaws started to be exploited
by a Chinese state-sponsored APT
(advanced persistent threat) group it dubbed *Hafnium*.
link:https://www.secureworldexpo.com/industry-news/microsoft-attacks-exchange-servers[Based on the procedures] and strategies observed,
Microsoft said it is a modern and skilled team
with a history of attacks against Office 365 users.
Indeed, it is a Chinese group
but "primarily operates from leased virtual private servers (VPS)
in the United States," link:https://www.zdnet.com/article/update-immediately-microsoft-rushes-out-patches-for-exchange-server-zero-day-attacks/[said Tung in ZDNet].

These attackers could access users' mailboxes, extract content,
and install backdoors on compromised servers for persistent access
and control through such security flaws in the software.
Their first reported attacks impacted higher education
and research institutions, law firms, policy think tanks, defense contractors,
and NGOs, mainly in the United States.
The situation looked thornier when the investigation revealed attacks
against the U.S. government agencies.
Curiously, these critical vulnerabilities' exploitation
could affect servers running MES 2013, 2016, and 2019
(on-premises products) _but not_ Exchange Online (cloud-hosted service).

Microsoft began to publicly request all companies
that were making use of MES
to apply the updates _as soon as possible_.
At the same time, link:https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/03/02/new-nation-state-cyberattacks/[it reflected concern]
that other malicious hacker groups beyond Hafnium
could also quickly target unpatched systems.
(link:https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-you-need-to-know-about-microsoft-exchange-server-hack/[It seems] this has already happened.)
On March 3, the U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
issued link:https://cyber.dhs.gov/ed/21-02/[an emergency directive] regarding the matter.
It asked all government agencies to comply with the installation of patches,
especially if there were no indicators of compromise
in their networks and systems.
Otherwise, they should "disconnect their Microsoft Exchange on-premises servers
and report their findings to CISA for further investigation,"
link:https://www.zdnet.com/article/cisa-issues-emergency-directive-to-agencies-deal-with-microsoft-exchange-bugs-now/[said Osborne in ZDNet].

The next day, link:https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/03/04/update-alert-mitigating-microsoft-exchange-server-vulnerabilities[CISA updated the alert],
reporting they were "aware of threat actors using open source tools
to search for vulnerable [MESs]"
and that agencies needed to look for signs of suspicious behavior
from at least September 1, 2020.
Then, link:https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/03/06/microsoft-ioc-detection-tool-exchange-server-vulnerabilities[on March 6, CISA recommended] that agencies
urgently run the link:https://github.com/microsoft/CSS-Exchange/tree/main/Security[script that Microsoft released] at that time
to determine if their systems had been compromised.
Around those days, Chris Krebs,
who was director of CISA until link:https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/trump-says-us-cybersecurity-chief-chris-krebs-has-been-terminated.html[Trump fired him],
link:https://twitter.com/C_C_Krebs/status/1368004411545579525[posted on his Twitter account] an intriguing question:
"Is this a flex in the early days of the Biden admin to test their resolve?"
In fact, if we go to CNN Politics, we can find a post titled:
link:https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/06/politics/microsoft-hack-task-force/index.html["Biden administration expected] to form [a] task force
to deal with Microsoft hack linked to China."

== What are the four flaws?

The four MES zero-day vulnerabilities
involved in this case are officially tracked as
link:https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26855[CVE-2021-26855], link:https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26857[CVE-2021-26857], link:https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26858[CVE-2021-26858], and link:https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-27065[CVE-2021-27065].
The discovery of the first one (also known as link:https://proxylogon.com/[ProxyLogon])
and the last one is attributed to the researcher
"Orange Tsai" of link:https://devco.re/en/about/[Devcore],
a team of professionals who in October 2020
started reviewing MES security.

- *CVE-2021-26855* (CVSS 9.1) is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
vulnerability that allows link:https://www.zdnet.com/article/update-immediately-microsoft-rushes-out-patches-for-exchange-server-zero-day-attacks/["the attacker to] send arbitrary HTTP requests
and authenticate as the Exchange server."
- *CVE-2021-26857* (CVSS 7.8) "is an insecure deserialization vulnerability
in the Unified Messaging service."
It allows attackers to "run code as SYSTEM on the Exchange server,"
only if they combine it with another flaw or use stolen credentials.
- *CVE-2021-26858* (CVSS 7.8) and *CVE-2021-27065* (CVSS 7.8)
are post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerabilities.
"If Hafnium could authenticate with the Exchange server,
then they could use [any of these vulnerabilities]
to write a file to any path on the server."

According to several sources, attackers can carry out attacks
using one or more of the above flaws.
Therefore, they can write and deploy backdoor 'web shells' on the servers
and have a foothold to execute further attacks.
(Web shells are small, easy-to-use link:https://www.zdnet.com/article/update-immediately-microsoft-rushes-out-patches-for-exchange-server-zero-day-attacks/["scripts that provide] a basic interface
for remote access to a compromised system.")
These can involve stealing credentials, installing malware
(link:https://securelist.com/zero-day-vulnerabilities-in-microsoft-exchange-server/101096/[Kaspersky mentioned] the high risks of ransomware),
stealing full email inboxes, adding rogue user accounts, among others.

== How worrying is the situation?

The incident with these vulnerabilities link:https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-you-need-to-know-about-microsoft-exchange-server-hack/[seems to have no connection]
with the SolarWinds supply chain attack
that has affected around 18,000 organizations worldwide.
In this new indiscriminate attack,
it appears that the number of organizations impacted is approximately 30,000.
More recently, some authors have link:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-07/hackers-breach-thousands-of-microsoft-customers-around-the-world[even reported *60,000*].
In addition to the types of organizations previously mentioned as victims
are link:https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/at-least-30000-u-s-organizations-newly-hacked-via-holes-in-microsofts-email-software/["banks, credit unions], non-profits, telecommunications providers,
public utilities and police, fire and rescue units."

It is currently quite worrying how slowly different companies
and government agencies are patching their systems.
Some even consider that there may be more severe results from this hack
attributed to the Chinese than from the one related to SolarWinds.
As the cybersecurity expert link:https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/at-least-30000-u-s-organizations-newly-hacked-via-holes-in-microsofts-email-software/[Brian Krebs has said],
"By all accounts, rooting out these intruders is going to require
an unprecedented and urgent nationwide clean-up effort."
But the longer it takes everyone to remove the backdoors
and update their systems, the longer attackers will continue to prowl
their networks and even expand their access, reach, and damage.

Let's keep the following in mind:
link:https://www.zdnet.com/article/multiple-nation-state-groups-are-hacking-microsoft-exchange-servers/[Last year, Microsoft] had already warned its MES customers
to patch a different critical vulnerability (link:https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2020-0688[CVE-2020-0688]).
Nevertheless, months after the first attacks,
link:https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-exchange-zero-day-attacks-30000-servers-hit-already-says-report/["tens of thousands"] of clients still had their systems
not updated with the released patch.
link:https://www.zdnet.com/article/update-immediately-microsoft-rushes-out-patches-for-exchange-server-zero-day-attacks/["Microsoft is concerned] it could see the same scenario play out again
with this set of Exchange server vulnerabilities."
We will see what happens. For now, Microsoft continues with investigations
and offering guidance to its customers on risk mitigation.
