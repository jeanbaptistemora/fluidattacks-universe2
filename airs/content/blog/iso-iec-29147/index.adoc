= Don't Be Ignorant of ISO/IEC 29147

If you go and look at link:../thoughtless-reporting/[my last post],
you'll discover or recall what happened recently
to the Colombian Foreign Ministry and its digital visa platform.
On that occasion, I referred to a "thoughtless vulnerability reporting"
by the user who identified the weakness in that platform
and by a group of journalists who published it on social networks.
However, before finding out the details of that event, reflecting on it,
and gathering words to offer to you through this medium,
I was asked to review something else.
I mean something I mentioned briefly in that writing,
but judiciously posed to the reader as a possible forthcoming topic
I would address here: *ISO/IEC 29147:2018*.

link:https://www.iso.org/about-us.html[As shared on their website],
*ISO* (the International Organization for Standardization)
"is an independent, non-governmental international organization."
"[It] brings together experts to share knowledge and develop voluntary,
consensus-based, market relevant International Standards
that support innovation and provide solutions to global challenges."
With the number *35*, we have the 'link:https://www.iso.org/ics/35/x/[Information technology]' group
in link:https://www.iso.org/standards-catalogue/browse-by-ics.html[their standards catalog], where, among 15 different subgroups,
*35.030* corresponds to the 'link:https://www.iso.org/ics/35.030/x/[IT Security (including encryption)].'
There, we find the link:https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html[ISO/IEC 29147:2018],
'Information technology -Security techniques- Vulnerability disclosure.'
Here we will introduce you to what the experts in this standard
have to offer to all interested parties.

== Overview

This standard takes as its primary subject *Vulnerability Disclosure*,
i.e., in a nutshell, the act of informing stakeholders
about an IT system's vulnerability.
You likely know that a vulnerability could be described
as a security weakness in a system that could compromise
multiple assets and operations when exploited by attackers.
Factors such as the origin, severity,
and impact generated by a vulnerability are variable characteristics.
Nevertheless, when someone finds a vulnerability,
at least in the first instance,
what matters is not what its specific features are
but the mere fact of reporting it.
From an ethical conduct stance, _everyone_, whether we're paid for it or not,
should report or disclose any vulnerabilities identified
for our well-being and that of others.

ISO chiefly directs this standard to vendors
who may receive vulnerability reports and publish information (advisories)
on their verification and remediation, for which they are responsible.
Following ISO concepts, the reporter (usually the finder)
is the person or organization that provides information
on a potential vulnerability to the vendor or coordinator.
On the other hand, the latter acts as an intermediary
if communication and negotiation between stakeholders require it.
It's relevant to note that apart from users,
coordinators and even vendors can act as reporters.

The procedures of receiving reports and distributing remediation advisories
are only two elements of a broader process.
Some of the other steps involve different International Standards,
such as the link:https://www.iso.org/standard/69725.html[ISO/IEC 30111] for vulnerability handling methods,
which we may discuss on another occasion.
In general terms, we could describe that process as follows:
a reporter contacts a vendor about a potential vulnerability,
the vendor verifies the material and, if dealing with a genuine exposure,
develops and implements remediation,
subsequently publishing a related advisory to stakeholders.

However, as the main focus of this post,
let's mention some ISO recommendations that can serve as a valuable support
for those companies that want to establish or enhance
their vulnerability disclosure policies and methods.

== Preparation

For the appropriate receipt of reports, as a priority,
vendors should develop policies and a comprehensive program
that must be visible and available to all potential reporters.
While it is ideal for a company to keep its IT systems under assessment
through third-party vendors such as `Fluid Attacks`,
it is always prudent to have everything ready
to receive reports from any source.
The lack of a vulnerability disclosure program can lead to reporters
ending up publishing information
without the vendor knowing about it beforehand.
Similar in a certain way to what occurred to the Colombian Foreign Ministry.
However, when the issue is not already public,
reporters should try to transmit the sensitive vulnerability information
confidentially to prevent attacks.
It would also be great to give vendors enough time
to fix the vulnerabilities found before talking about them publicly.

== Policies

Although vendors could adhere to existing vulnerability disclosure policies,
they could also create policies that apply to their employees and affiliates,
and individuals outside the companies.
Among their particular requirements,
vendors should make public their intentions, expectations,
and responsibilities concerning all stakeholders
in an accurate and straightforward manner that facilitates communication.
Policies should also contain information on preferred contact mechanisms
and their security technology for confidentiality, as well as
details on the required content for every report, among other things.

== Receiving reports

The capability to receive vulnerability reports
and establish efficient working relationships
and ensure all involved people's safety
adheres to the vendor's preparation phase.
The reporting mechanisms to be enabled to reporters could be, as usual,
emails, issue tracking systems, and web forms,
but all of them should be as protected and confidential as possible.
In addition, to facilitate the next step
of verifying the potential vulnerability,
the vendor should ask reporters for data such as the affected product/service,
type of weakness, cause, severity, impact, evidence, among others.
Of course, the vendor needs to be aware
that a report made by a person who found the vulnerability,
for example, by accident, is not going to include all that required data.
Consequently, that operation always depends on
the reporter's technical knowledge, and the vendor should be prepared for it.

On the other hand, prepared and capable vendors should regularly monitor
their reporting mechanisms, communications on reports already received,
and internal channels and public sources for possible vulnerability reports.
Vendors should be ready to give quick
but simultaneously meaningful responses to reporters.
(*Caution*: frustrated reporters may choose to release information
wherever they feel inclined to do so.)
Next, a reporter has the right to be informed
whether the vulnerability has begun to be under investigation,
whether more information is required in their report,
or whether it is currently irrelevant.
In those cases where reports lead to research,
the previously mentioned link:https://www.iso.org/standard/69725.html[vulnerability handling processes] appear,
and the vendors build and test remediations
about which later should distribute advisories.
Certainly, they should not forget to keep reporters up to date.

== Distributing remediation advisories

Vendors may disseminate advisories related to vulnerability remediation
either only to their users or to the general public.
Users should receive information on the affected products/services
and the remediation achieved along with corresponding instructions.
For example, sometimes, users have to install updates or patches
that constitute vulnerability fixing.
Nevertheless, it is preferable to have automatic update deployment systems.
In contrast, when a vulnerability is under exploitation,
and no remediation is available,
vendors should inform users about the threat
and temporary solutions and guidelines to reduce risks.
Always bearing in mind that if the information is public,
it must avoid the exhibition of any specification
advantageous to malicious hackers.
