= Choosing the Right Pentesting Team

Data breaches and multiple cyberattacks
against companies of all types and sizes
in the now predominant digital world continue to increase.
(See information link:../cybersecurity-2020-21-i/[here] on the previous year's cybercriminal trends.)
Many of these companies have realized the need to use security testing
on their systems to determine if they are vulnerable
to potential threats and carry out the required improvements ASAP.
However, some companies may only go so far as to think about
complying with industry standards and consumer protection regulations
such as link:../../compliance/hipaa/[HIPAA], link:../../compliance/pci/[PCI DSS], and link:../../compliance/gdpr/[GDPR].
One way or another, in security assessment,
the link:../../solutions/penetration-testing/[Penetration Testing] (pentesting) solution over the years
has been gaining more value and popularity among organizations
beyond government agencies and banks.

For this reason, the pentesting market has become much more extensive,
with more and more pentesting vendors offering their services,
making it increasingly complex for companies
interested in their implementation to choose.
As the professional pentester link:https://securityboulevard.com/2020/06/5-tips-for-selecting-a-penetration-testing-company-in-2020/[Elliot expressed at Security Boulevard] last year,
"Selecting a penetration testing company can be a daunting task.
It's an industry plagued with misleading sales tactics, weak certifications,
and simply unqualified professionals." As a consequence,
different companies and individuals involved in cybersecurity
have been suggesting through their media some tips
to take into account when choosing pentesting providers.

Before going with those tips to better understand the market,
let's get a little more familiar with the concept.
link:https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/the-history-of-penetration-testing/#gref[In the late 1960s], so-called 'tiger teams' began to emerge
to test the ability of government and business systems to resist cyberattacks.
Among the pioneers of penetration testing development is James P. Anderson,
who in the 1970s established final testing steps for those tiger teams.
However, it seems that it was only recently, in 2009,
that a penetration execution standard was defined to test systems
for ways to breach them and gain access to data.
This rigorous approach combines manual procedures by ethical hackers
and automated checks by tools, the former being predominant.
In short, pentesting is a security assessment
with a simulation of genuine attacks to identify vulnerabilities
that cybercriminals could exploit in a particular environment.

A year ago, link:https://www.netspi.com/blog/executive/penetration-testing/the-penetration-testing-paradox-criteria-for-evaluating-providers/[Charles Horton published a post] for NetSPI
outlining four attributes that you can consider
when choosing an appropriate pentesting
and vulnerability management team for your organization.
Initially, he refers to the undeniable importance of having *a talented group*.
Each of the pentesters should have the ability to view the targets
through the eyes of malicious hackers.
They should be agile in acquiring knowledge and improving techniques
to employ according to the needs of their clients
and the new complexities in their field. Of course,
you should verify that it is really a team that you will link with your staff
and not a single individual on whom all the weight and responsibility falls.

In relation to the talent attribute, we can see that other sources
(e.g., link:https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/top-10-things-look-avoid-choosing-pen-testing-vendor/[Infosec] and link:https://medium.com/intruder-io/how-to-choose-a-pentesting-company-5eddc82982d1[Intruder]) also talk about certifications and experience.
They recommend you to look for pentesting teams
with members holding link:../../about-us/certifications/[industry-recognized professional certifications]
such as CEH, CRTE, OSCE, OSCP, OSWE, and OSWP.
Some confidence may be generated by such credentials
regarding the competence of the pentesters. But beware,
they should not be taken as a sufficient measure to choose a team!
As Elliot says, the certifications "still fall very short
of [what's] expected of a skillful pentester.
Remember that certification bodies inherently must target
a large enough group of people to stay profitable."
Instead, he invites you to pay close attention to companies' git repositories
as well as their research and publications.

As a second attribute, Horton highlights the ability of the team
to maintain standardized and,
at the same time, customizable pentesting processes.
Through *standardization* (as can be done,
for instance, with pentest checklists),
a specialized company should guarantee consistent results
across different evaluation projects.
Regarding *customization*, they should demonstrate that they can recognize
the similarities and differences between their customers
and are able to adjust to them in their penetration testing.

Customization is related to flexibility, an open mindset,
a quality that a pentester must possess.
The analysts you choose for your organization's assessments
should be curious and creative, always interested in learning new techniques
and about environments in which to simulate attacks.
Of course, to ensure that there is an appropriate match to your needs
by the pentesters involved, keep in mind the words of link:https://medium.com/intruder-io/how-to-choose-a-pentesting-company-5eddc82982d1[Andrew at Intruder]:
"make sure your potential provider has relevant experience
in the types of technology you're working with."

In a third point, Horton mentions that an excellent pentesting team
for your business should know *how to handle and present the data*
obtained from the analysis.
All this in a way that facilitates your staff
to quickly and effectively remediate vulnerabilities.
It is the pentesting force with its tools that should organize
detailed reports and prioritize the findings for you,
saving you some administrative headaches.
Following link:https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/top-10-things-look-avoid-choosing-pen-testing-vendor/[Brecht at Infosec], pentesting reports
can be swamped with technical jargon, which would mean a problem.
This is why the ability to communicate complexity in understandable terms
for non-technical executives is highly valued.
So, request, review, and compare sample reports from providers!

We can also add to the above that it is strictly necessary
that the company providing the service allows establishing a documented pact
of confidentiality and data security. Beforehand,
there must be liability insurance from the vendor
to protect your company from any damage or loss
related to your systems and information assets.
Additionally, you must know who will be the pentesters in charge
of conducting the tests and how the data will be managed,
requesting information such as names and bios.

Horton ends with an attribute that emphasizes
the collaborative quality of the pentesting team.
From the outset, the members of these evaluation groups should be trained
to possess a collective mindset. Beyond sharing knowledge internally,
it's about expanding it, delivering it to others
outside the corporate boundaries,
and contributing to a community dedicated to cybersecurity.
We can add here that, about the collaboration that your company can receive,
the pentesting team should know
how to keep constant and clear communication with your staff.
They should always provide feedback on progress, difficulties, and results,
along with valuable recommendations for action.

Selecting a competent penetration testing provider is not a simple task,
but it is ideal for detecting vulnerabilities in your systems
and keeping your organization healthy.
