= Sudo Heap Overflow CVE-2021-3156

On January 26 of 2021, Qualys
link:https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-research/2021/01/26/cve-2021-3156-heap-based-buffer-overflow-in-sudo-baron-samedit[published] a
new vulnerability discovered on `sudo`, a tool used to perform actions as
other users (most commonly as `root`) on Linux-based systems.

Although Qualys provided a very good
link:https://www.qualys.com/2021/01/26/cve-2021-3156/baron-samedit-heap-based-overflow-sudo.txt[analysis]
of the vulnerability, they didn't state how they found it.

In this post, we will show a way to discover this kind of bugs using
link:https://aflplus.plus/[AFL++], a community-fork
of link:https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/[American Fuzzy Lop], a
link:../fuzzing-forallsecure[fuzzer] that uses compile-time instrumentation
and genetic algorithms to find, among other things, security bugs.

== Preparing the environment

First, we need to install `AFL`. You just need to clone the
link:https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus[repo] and follow the
instructions. The only needed change I did was to specify a version
for the `libstdc++-dev` package. It needs to be the same of the `gcc` compiler
on your system:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus.git
$ cd AFLplusplus/
$ gcc --version
gcc (Debian 10.2.1-6) 10.2.1 20210110
Copyright (C) 2020 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
$ sudo apt install build-essential python3-dev automake flex bison libglib2.0-dev libpixman-1-dev clang python3-setuptools clang llvm llvm-dev libstdc++-10-dev
$ make distrib
$ sudo make install
----

And check the installation with:

[source,bash]
----
$ afl-gcc --version
afl-cc ++3.01a by Michal Zalewski, Laszlo Szekeres, Marc Heuse - mode: GCC-GCC
gcc (Debian 10.2.1-6) 10.2.1 20210110
Copyright (C) 2020 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
----

Now, we need to link:https://www.sudo.ws/download.html[download] one of the
affected versions of `sudo`. We will use `1.9.5p1`.

[source,bash]
----
$ wget -c https://www.sudo.ws/dist/sudo-1.9.5p1.tar.gz
$ tar xzf sudo-1.9.5p1.tar.gz
----

Now we have everything we need!

== Patching sudo for fuzzing purposes

`AFL` uses instrumented fuzzing only on binaries built with their compilers.
Instrumented mode helps `AFL` to perform coverage-guided fuzzing
and generate mutating input based on measured behavior of previous payloads.

However, `AFL` will expect parameters coming from the standard input and
files
link:https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/afl-users/c/ZBWq0LdHBzw/m/zBlo7q9LBAAJ[only].

`sudo` uses command-line arguments which is not compatible with `AFL`.
However, there is a
link:https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/tree/stable/utils/argv_fuzzing[way]
provided by `AFL` to fuzz those kind of binaries:
A `C` header that converts a standard input payload to `argv[]` parameters.

To do that, we just need to:

* Copy over the file
`AFLplusplus/utils/argv_fuzzing/argv-fuzz-inl.h` to the main source of `sudo`.
* Modify the `main()` function of `sudo` to call the `AFL_INIT_ARGV()` macro.

[source,bash]
----
~/sudo-1.9.5p1$ cp ../AFLplusplus/utils/argv_fuzzing/argv-fuzz-inl.h src/
----

----

This will work by converting all the expected `argv[]` array from standard
input, with parameters separated by a `\0` byte and terminating the array with
a double `\0\0`.

We also need to disable the `sudo` password prompt, or the fuzzing will hang.

Now, we can build our patched `sudo`. As it needs to be built with `AFL`
compilers, we must overwrite the `CC` environment variable. We may also want
to enable debugging symbols and finally we should install it on a isolated
path so we can safely remove it when we finish our fuzzing session. We can do
that by issuing:

[source,bash]
----
$ CFLAGS="-g" LDFLAGS="-g" CC=afl-clang-fast ./configure --prefix=/fuzz/sudo
$ make
$ sudo make install
----

This will install our modified `sudo` on `/fuzz/sudo`. To check that our
installation, along with the patches worked, just type:

[source,bash]
----
$ echo -ne "sudo\0id\0\0" | /fuzz/sudo/bin/sudo
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
----

Great, now it's fuzzing time!

== Fuzzing sudo

When using `AFL`, I recommend to have a separate directory on which you can
store the inputs and outputs for each fuzzed binary. I will create mine at
`$HOME/fuzz/sudo`

[source,bash]
----
~/fuzz$ mkdir -p sudo/{input,output}
----

The `output` directory will be on where `AFL` will store the fuzzing state.
As this directory will be extensively written to, it is recommended to use
a RAM-based filesystem to improve performance and avoid damaging `SSD` disks.

[source,bash]
----
~/fuzz/sudo$ sudo mount -t tmpfs tmpfs output
----

In the `input` directory, we will create initial payloads for `sudo`

[source,bash]
----
~/fuzz/sudo$ echo -ne "sudo\0id\0\0" > input/payload1
~/fuzz/sudo$ echo -ne "sudoedit\0id\0\0" > input/payload2
----

Fuzzing is CPU-intensive, but you can use parallel fuzzing with `AFL`. I
used a 8-core PC and launched a `Master` `AFL` instance:

[source,bash]
----
~/fuzz/sudo$ afl-fuzz -i input/ -o output/ -M fuzz01 /fuzz/sudo/bin/sudo
----

And launched 6 `Slave` instances on different consoles:

[source,bash]
----
$ ~/fuzz/sudo$ afl-fuzz -i input/ -o output/ -S fuzz02 /fuzz/sudo/bin/sudo
$ ~/fuzz/sudo$ afl-fuzz -i input/ -o output/ -S fuzz03 /fuzz/sudo/bin/sudo
$ ~/fuzz/sudo$ afl-fuzz -i input/ -o output/ -S fuzz04 /fuzz/sudo/bin/sudo
$ ~/fuzz/sudo$ afl-fuzz -i input/ -o output/ -S fuzz05 /fuzz/sudo/bin/sudo
$ ~/fuzz/sudo$ afl-fuzz -i input/ -o output/ -S fuzz06 /fuzz/sudo/bin/sudo
----

It looked like this:

image::parallel1.png[Parallel Fuzzing]

And just after a few minutes of fuzzing, one of the slaves showed 3 crashes!

image::crash1.png[Parallel Fuzzing]

The payloads that caused the crashes can be found here:

[source,bash]
----
~/fuzz/sudo$ ls output/fuzz03/crashes/id\:00000*
4 output/fuzz03/crashes/id:000000,sig:06,src:000002+000209,time:276568,op:splice,rep:2
4 output/fuzz03/crashes/id:000001,sig:06,src:000125,time:404770,op:havoc,rep:8
4 output/fuzz03/crashes/id:000002,sig:06,src:000305,time:1623276,op:arith8,pos:20,val:-24
----

If we examine the contents of those payloads, we can see that they all invoked
`sudoedit` with the `-s` and `-i` flags. `AFL` mutated the original input
payloads and eventually triggered the bug found by Qualys.

image::vuln1.png[Crash payloads]

We can also replicate the crash, simply by passing the offending payloads to
our `sudo`:

[source,bash]
----
~/fuzz/sudo$ /fuzz/sudo/bin/sudo < output/fuzz03/crashes/id:000000,sig:06,src:000002+000209,time:276568,op:splice,rep:2
malloc(): invalid size (unsorted)
Aborted
----

And you can use `GDB` to start the exploitation process:

== Conclusion

It is easy to find crashes on software using `AFL` if you have the source
code. It's also unbelievable that a bug like this took 10 years to be found
on `sudo`!
