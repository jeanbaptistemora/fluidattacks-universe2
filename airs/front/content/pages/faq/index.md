<div class="faq-title">

1\. What is Continuous Hacking?

</div>

Continuous Hacking is a security testing service that allows the hacking
process to begin at an early stage in the software development cycle.
Its purpose is to guarantee `100%` testing coverage of the application.

<div class="faq-title">

2\. What are the benefits of Continuous Hacking?

</div>

Continuous Hacking: . Minimizes the cost of remediation (repair) of a
vulnerable security risk while the software is in development rather
than when it is in production.

1. Reduces application certification time to zero because the hacking
    is done during development.

2. Provides clear and detailed information about vulnerable security
    risks and facilitates a coordinated effort between external project
    personnel (`Fluid Attacks` experts) identifying security risks, and
    internal project personnel (client company) fixing security issues
    without delays.

<div class="faq-title">

3\. In what industries does Fluid Attacks have experience?

</div>

Along our career trajectory we have been working with companies from
different sectors, such as financial, transportation, industrial,
consumer, communications, technology and utilities.

<div class="faq-title">

4\. How does Fluid Attacks stay on top of new techniques and changes?

</div>

We ensure to constantly research and keep updated with the new
techniques and changes related to cybersecurity and `IT`. Through [blog
entries](../../blog) we keep our team updated with the state of art.

<div class="faq-title">

5\. What are the necessary inputs and requirements for Continuous Hacking?

</div>

The necessary inputs and requirements are:

1. **Phase 1:** Access to the integration branch of the repository for
    the not-yet-deployed application’s source code. Ethical Hacking
    focuses on the source code.

2. **Phase 2:** When the project has a deployed application
    (Integration Environment), the hacking coverage expands to include
    application security testing.

3. **Phase 3:** This phase applies only if the infrastructure
    supporting the application is defined as code and kept in the
    integration branch of the repository referred to in Phase 1. This
    phase includes infrastructure hacking.

<div class="faq-title">

6\. What are the technical conditions that I must meet for Continuous Hacking?

</div>

Access to `Git` and a monitored environment in the branch are required,
through automated Linux. The following environments are not supported:

1. Access through a `VPN` that only runs on `Windows`.

2. `VPN` in `Windows` that requires manual interaction such as an `OTP`
    token.

3. `VPN` Site to Site.

<div class="faq-title">

7\. What type of hacking is included in Continuous Hacking?

</div>

Continuous Hacking includes source code analysis, application hacking
(see question 5), and infrastructure hacking (see question 5).

<div class="faq-title">

8\. What is a vulnerability?

</div>

A vulnerability is anything that represents a security risk (Integrity,
Availability, Confidentiality, Non-repudiation) to the application.

<div class="faq-title">

9\. What is an active author and how can I identify it?

</div>

An active author is a user with access to the `Git` repository who makes
changes to the stored code in the repository during the analyzed month.

<div class="faq-title">

10\. Does Continuous Hacking use a series of automated tools
or is it the result of a manual (by hand) process?

</div>

Automated tools, by themselves, are not capable of extracting sensitive
business information, such as client or employee information. In our
Continuous Hacking service, we use a series of tools which are acquired
and developed by us at `Fluid Attacks`, as well as a detailed review
process performed by our expert technical staff. We go the extra mile
because automated tools present the following problems:

1. Vulnerability leakages (detection of a minimal percentage of
    existing security risk vulnerabilities).

2. Detected vulnerabilities are primarily false positives.

3. Incapability of combining individual vulnerabilities in order to
    reveal additional vulnerabilities which may be an even greater
    security risk than the individual vulnerabilities alone.

<div class="faq-title">

11\. If Continuous Hacking includes a manual review, how does Fluid Attacks
ensure that development cycles are not slowed down?

</div>

Continuous Hacking is first performed on the source code. This allows
for hacking and development to occur simultaneously, which in turn
minimizes the dependency on functional environments, as well as the need
for coordination between hackers and developers. The decisions regarding
which findings are prioritized for each sprint rest solely with the
client. Unless we are dealing with a company with daily `CI/CD`
(Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment), not all sprints generate
code eligible for release and deployment, which improves the remediation
(repair) time for detected vulnerabilities.

<div class="faq-title">

12\. If Continuous Hacking is done manually, how can a big project move rapidly
and expand as more active authors (developers) join the team?

</div>

Standard Continuous Hacking covers `95%` of all business applications
being developed, as the subscription is based on the number of active
developers in the project and this defines the amount of resources
assigned to the project.

<div class="faq-title">

13\. If Continuous Hacking is done manually, how does it move rapidly
when a client has a big application portfolio that is constantly increasing?

</div>

Based on our historical data, and thanks to our recruitment and training
capabilities, as well as our ability to innovate internal processes, we
are fully capable of taking on between `5` and `10` new applications
each month.

<div class="faq-title">

14\. What kind of information does Fluid Attacks need in order to provide a quotation?

</div>

To provide a proposal, we need to determine what the target of
evaluation (scope) will be. So, we require the following information:

1. **One-shot hacking** (by project):

    1. How many ports are included in the scope?

    2. How many inputs of applications are included in the scope?

    3. How many `LoC` are included in the scope? We recommend running
        [`CLOC`](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc) in order to
        facilitate quantification.

**Note:** It would be desirable to obtain the access credentials
(standard user, not privileges) to the applications in cases where this
will be included.

1. **Continuous hacking** (`SDLC`): Under this model, we need to know
    how many active authors will be involved in the project.

Regarding the health check estimation, the same considerations apply as
for one-shot hacking, so the client should provide the above-mentioned
information as well.

<div class="faq-title">

15\. Does the cost of Continuous Hacking vary according
to the scope or development phases?

</div>

Yes. The service cost varies depending on the number of active authors
identified in the project each month.

<div class="faq-title">

16\. Why is it necessary for Continuous Hacking to have access
to the source code stored in the repository?

</div>

Continuous Hacking needs access to the source code because it is based
on continuous attacks on the latest version available.

<div class="faq-title">

17\. When does Continuous Hacking begin?

</div>

Continuous Hacking begins immediately after receiving the purchase
order.

<div class="faq-title">

18\. Why is there a month 0 and how does setup work?

</div>

Month `0` begins the test setup and is the start of the monthly payment.
A project leader is assigned who is responsible for managing the
connection of environments, profiling, user creation, allocation of
privileges, and all the necessary inputs to begin the review without
setbacks.

<div class="faq-title">

19\. Is it possible to hire On-the-Premises Continuous Hacking?

</div>

No. Due to the operational model that supports Continuous Hacking, it
can only be done remotely.

<div class="faq-title">

20\. Is it possible to schedule follow-up meetings?

</div>

Yes. All applications covered by the contract for Continuous Hacking are
assigned to a specific project leader who is available to attend all
necessary meetings. We simply require sufficient notice of an impending
meeting in order to schedule availability.

<div class="faq-title">

21\. How is a project’s progress determined?

</div>

A project’s progress and current state is determined using the following
metrics: . Source code coverage indicator. . Percentage of remediated
(repaired) security risk vulnerabilities.

<div class="faq-title">

22\. When does Continuous Hacking end?

</div>

Continuous Hacking is contracted for a minimum of `12` months and is
renewed automatically at the end of the `12-month` time period.
Continuous Hacking ends when we receive a written request through
previously defined channels to terminate the contract.

<div class="faq-title">

23\. Can the contract be canceled at any point in time?

</div>

You can cancel your contract at any time after the fourth month.
Cancellation can be requested through any communication channel
previously defined in the contract.

<div class="faq-title">

24\. When the coverage of my application reaches 100%, is Continuous Hacking
suspended until new code is added to the repository?

</div>

No. Even if `100%` of coverage is reached, we continue checking already
attacked source code to identify any possible false negatives, including
components developed by third parties in our hacking process.

<div class="faq-title">

25\. How is the severity and criticality of the vulnerability calculated?

</div>

`Fluid Attacks` uses [CVSS](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (Common
Vulnerability Scoring System), a “standardized framework used to rate
the severity of security vulnerabilities in software.” It gives us a
quantitative measure ranging from `0` to `10`, `0` being the lowest
level of risk and `10` the highest and most critical level of risk,
based on the qualitative characteristics of a vulnerability.

<div class="faq-title">

26\. How do I get information about the vulnerabilities found in my application?

</div>

Continuous Hacking has an interactive reporting platform, our Attack
Surface Manager (`ASM`). `ASM` gives all project stakeholders access to
details concerning vulnerabilities reported by `Fluid Attacks`. (We have
the source code of all our
[products](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/product) in our [public
repository](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks).)

<div class="faq-title">

27\. What types of reports does Continuous Hacking generate?

</div>

Continuous Hacking generates and delivers, through `ASM`, a technical
report available in `Excel` and/or `PDF` format during the execution of
the project contract. Once the project ends, `ASM` delivers a
presentation and an executive report, also in `PDF` format.

<div class="faq-title">

28\. What happens after Fluid Attacks reports a vulnerability?

</div>

Once `Fluid Attacks` reports a vulnerability, the main objective for
developers is to eliminate it. Through `ASM`, a client company’s
developers can access first-hand detailed information regarding a
vulnerability in order to plan and execute corrective measures to remove
it from the application.

<div class="faq-title">

29\. What communication does Fluid Attacks provide? When? How?

</div>

For Continuous Hacking, communication takes place between developers and
hackers on a day-to-day basis via `ASM`. In One-shot Hacking,
communication is handled through the project manager (`PM`) as a single
point of contact (`SPOC`).

<div class="faq-title">

30\. How does Fluid Attacks know a vulnerability has been eliminated or remediated?

</div>

Through `ASM`, any user with access to the project can request
verification of a remediated vulnerability. A request for verification
that a remediated vulnerability no longer poses a risk must be
accompanied by notification from you that the planned remediation has
been executed. We then perform a closing verification to confirm the
effectiveness of the remediation. Results of the closing verification
are then forwarded to the project team by email.

<div class="faq-title">

31\. How many closing verifications are included in Continuous Hacking?

</div>

Continuous Hacking offers unlimited closing verifications.

<div class="faq-title">

32\. Why do I need to notify Fluid Attacks that a remediation
has been executed if you already have access to the source code repositories?

</div>

One of Continuous Hacking’s objectives is to maintain clear and
effortless communication between all project members. This is
accomplished when you notify us because the message goes through `ASM`
and by doing so, the entire project team is notified.

<div class="faq-title">

33\. What happens if I do not consider something a vulnerability?

</div>

Within `ASM` there is a comment section. A client company can post its
reasons for believing a vulnerability finding is not valid. Our experts
and all other project members can then interface and discuss the
relative merits of the vulnerability finding as well as the validity of
it as a security risk, and a final determination can be made.

<div class="faq-title">

34\. Do all reported vulnerabilities have to be remediated?

</div>

No. However, this decision is made entirely by the client, not by us,
and the client assumes all responsibility for possible negative impacts
of non-remediation. In `ASM`, under the treatment option, a client
company indicates whether it will remediate or assume responsibility for
an identified vulnerability.

<div class="faq-title">

35\. If a client decides not to remediate a vulnerability,
thus assuming responsibility for it, is it excluded from the reports and ASM?

</div>

No. Reports and `ASM` include information regarding all vulnerabilities,
along with whether vulnerabilities were remediated or not. Your report
and `ASM` will include all the information with nothing excluded.

<div class="faq-title">

36\. If the application is stored along multiple repositories,
can they all be attacked?

</div>

Yes, with one condition. The code must be stored in the same branch in
each repository. For example: If it is agreed that all attacks will be
performed on the `QA` branch, then this same branch must be present in
all of the repositories included for Continuous Hacking.

<div class="faq-title">

37\. If I have code that was developed a long time ago,
is it possible to still use Continuous Hacking?

</div>

Yes, it is still possible to use Continuous Hacking. There are two
possible options available:

1. A Health Check can be performed testing all existing code. Then,
    Continuous Hacking is executed as usual within the defined scope
    (see question 11). This option is better suited for applications
    under development.

2. Start with the standard limits (see question 10), increasing the
    coverage on a monthly basis until `100%` is reached. This option is
    better suited for applications no longer in development.

<div class="faq-title">

38\. What does Fluid Attacks do to catch up with the revision
of the existing code before starting the hacking process?

</div>

We recommend that application development and the hacking process begin
simultaneously. However, this is not always possible. To catch up with
developers, we perform a [`Health
Check`](../../services/continuous-hacking/healthcheck/) (additional fees
apply). This means all versions of the existing code are attacked up to
the contracted starting point in addition to the monthly test limit.
This allows us to catch up with the development team within the first
`3` contract months. Then, we continue hacking simultaneously with the
development team as development continues.

<div class="faq-title">

39\. What happens if I don’t want to perform a Health Check,
but I want the Continuous Hacking service?

</div>

This is a risky choice. Not performing a Health Check means there will
be code that is never going to be tested and, therefore, it’s not
possible to know what vulnerabilities may exist in it; those
vulnerabilities are not going to be identified. We guarantee that `100%`
of the code change is going to be tested, but what cannot be reached,
cannot be tested.

<div class="faq-title">

40\. Do the repositories need to be in a specific version control system?

</div>

Continuous Hacking is based on using `Git` for version control.
Therefore, `Git` is necessary for Continuous Hacking.

<div class="faq-title">

41\. Does Fluid Attacks keep or store information
regarding the vulnerabilities found?

</div>

Information is only kept for the duration of the Continuous Hacking
contract. Once the contract has ended, information is kept for `7`
business days and then deleted from all our information systems.

<div class="faq-title">

42\. How will our data be erased?

</div>

`ASM` uses an automated erasing process, removing all the project
information from our systems and generating a `Proof of Delivery` signed
via [`Docusign`](https://www.docusign.com/).

<div class="faq-title">

43\. Does Continuous Hacking require any development methodology?

</div>

No. Continuous Hacking is independent of the client’s development
methodology. Continuous Hacking test results become a planning tool in
future development cycles. They do not prevent the continuation of
development.

<div class="faq-title">

44\. Will Fluid Attacks periodically do presentations
via teleconferencing? How do I set one up?

</div>

Yes. `Fluid Attacks` can schedule periodic presentations via
teleconferencing. To set up a teleconference presentation, you will need
to provide us with the emails of attendees and `3` optional time periods
of `1-hour` duration for the teleconference. We will then notify you of
the best time for the teleconference based on your availability and
ours, and send emails to your list of attendees inviting them to
participate.

<div class="faq-title">

45\. Does the use of the Continuous Hacking model depend
on the type of repository where the code is stored?

</div>

No. The client can use whatever repository they deem appropriate. We
only require access to the integration branch and its respective
environment.

<div class="faq-title">

46\. Who would be performing the work?

</div>

Our designated team of hackers.

<div class="faq-title">

47\. Can we see resumes?

</div>

Yes, you can access the `LinkedIn` profiles of some members of our team
on our [people](../../about-us/people) page.

<div class="faq-title">

48\. What certifications does Fluid Attacks have?

</div>

Please refer to our [certifications](../../about-us/certifications/)
page for further information.

<div class="faq-title">

49\. Do I lose my property rights if Fluid Attacks reviews my source code?

</div>

No. Reviewing your code in no way compromises your proprietary rights to
that code.

<div class="faq-title">

50\. Does Fluid Attacks have a tool that enables automatic remediation
and closing of previously confirmed vulnerabilities?

</div>

No. We used to have Asserts, an automated engine, checking remediation
of previously confirmed vulnerabilities. Now we **don’t offer** that
product.

<div class="faq-title">

51\. Does Continuous Hacking only focus on source code?
Is it possible to include the infrastructure associated with the app?

</div>

We have improved the Continuous Hacking model to now include
infrastructure within the Target of Evaluation (`ToE`). This includes
the application’s ports, inputs, infrastructure, and of course the
application itself.

<div class="faq-title">

52\. What external tools does Fluid Attacks use to perform pentesting?

</div>

We use [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp) for web testing, and
[CANVAS](https://www.immunityinc.com/products/canvas/) and [Core
Impact](https://www.coresecurity.com/products/core-impact) for
infrastructure testing with additional exploits.

<div class="faq-title">

53\. How will our data be transmitted?

</div>

It is up to you, however, we recommend the use of `HTTPS` for
application tests and `SSH` (`git`) for source code analysis.

<div class="faq-title">

54\. How will our data be stored?

</div>

- [`AWS` on the cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/) (mainly `S3` and
  [`DynamoDB`](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), all security
  enabled)

- Hackers' computers with disk encryption in all partitions.

<div class="faq-title">

55\. Where does ASM run?

</div>

The platform, `ASM`, runs in the cloud.

<div class="faq-title">

56\. Does Fluid Attacks manage the access credentials to ASM?

</div>

No. We use federated authentication. `Google` and `Azure`
(`Microsoft 360`) are the entities which validate your user access
credentials.

<div class="faq-title">

57\. Is it possible to activate the double authentication token?

</div>

Yes, it is, and we recommend you do so. Using double authentication will
increase the security level of your credentials. This will help prevent
unauthorized users from accessing and compromising your information.
This feature is enabled through `Gmail` or `Azure`.

<div class="faq-title">

58\. If I make a commit, how long does it take you
to review the commit and test it?

</div>

The goal is `100%` coverage. Therefore, there will be results regarding
system vulnerabilities continuously throughout the contract period. We
take into account all pushes to the tested branch, which are monitored
using automated scripts (robots) that extract and analyze the changes
made to the source code every night.

<div class="faq-title">

59\. Does Fluid Attacks test every time
I make a push in the subscription branch?

</div>

During the execution of a project, the following scenarios can occur:

1. Application in development without overdue code (`100%` coverage):
    The robot detects the change and generates the updated control
    files. This means that no specific file or commit is audited, but
    rather the change analysis performed by the robot is incorporated
    when the hackers attack the application, thus allowing them to take
    into account the changes made.

2. Application in production without overdue code (100% coverage): Even
    when there are no changes, the application is attacked. Internally,
    we have processes that help us identify why we haven’t found
    vulnerabilities in the application in 7, 14 and 21 days. These
    processes include such things as hacker rotations or increasing the
    number of hackers assigned to the project in order to find
    undiscovered vulnerabilities.

3. Application in development with overdue code (`<100%` coverage):
    Same as the first scenario, but attacks are only related to the
    change that was made. The attack surface that existed before the
    subscription point is not attacked.

4. Application in production with overdue code (`<100%` coverage): Same
    as the second scenario, but if in a specified month there is no new
    code, it is hacked only to the extent of the changes made by `one`
    active author in `one` previous month.

<div class="faq-title">

60\. What options for retesting are available?

</div>

[One-shot Hacking](../../services/one-shot-hacking) includes one retest.
[Continuous Hacking](../../services/continuous-hacking/) includes
infinite retests during the subscription time.

<div class="faq-title">

61\. What are the scheduled activities during the Continuous Hacking test?

</div>

Once the setup has been completed, and everything is ready for the
service to begin, the security tests start. The steps are as follows:

1. Approval request (purchase order confirmed).

2. Project leader assignment.

3. The project leader schedules the start meeting (teleconference).

4. Service condition validation.

5. Supplies request (access to environments and code).

6. The project leader receives supplies, and programs the setup of the
    verification and access robots.

7. The project leader creates an admin user in `ASM` for the client.

8. The admin user invites all project stakeholders including the
    developers. (They must have `Google Apps` or `Office365`.)

9. Vulnerabilities are reported in `ASM`.

10. Project stakeholders access vulnerabilities and start remediation.

11. If any questions or problems arise, they can be addressed through
      the comments or chat available in `ASM`.

12. When the client has remediated the reported vulnerabilities, they
      may request validation of their repairs through `ASM`.

13. Our hacker performs the closure verification and updates the report.

14. Steps `3` - `7` are repeated until the subscription ends.

<div class="faq-title">

62\. What technical conditions do I need to meet if
I want to use Asserts inside my continuous integrator?

</div>

We are not offering this product anymore.

<div class="faq-title">

63\. Is there documentation for Asserts?

</div>

Yes, it is available on the [Asserts
page](https://fluidattacks.gitlab.io/asserts/).

<div class="faq-title">

64\. Is it possible to group multiple applications into one subscription?
How would I recognize the vulnerabilities within each application?

</div>

According to the active authors model, it is possible to create a large
cell with all the developers or to divide it into applications according
to the client’s needs. When managing only one cell, it is important to
consider the following: \* All users in the project can see all the
vulnerabilities of the application inside the same cell. \* When the
same vulnerability appears in several applications, the only way to
identify/locate each one in each individual application is by checking
the vulnerability report under the heading "location". There, it will
specify where each vulnerability can be found.

<div class="faq-title">

65\. Is it possible to change the environment
when the subscription is already active?

</div>

Yes, it is possible under the condition that the new environment be the
same branch environment where the source code is reviewed, thus allowing
us to test the same version of the change both statically and
dynamically.

<div class="faq-title">

66\. How will you ensure the availability of my systems
and services while the test is taking place?

</div>

It is possible to cause an accidental `DoS` during the hacking service.
We recommend including only the staging phase in the scope. However,
many clients decide to also include the production stage in the tests.
It is unusual for us to take down environments because when we foresee a
possible breakpoint, we ask the client for a special environment within
which to carry out the test.

<div class="faq-title">

67\. What happens if I want to review different
environments of the same application?

</div>

The service includes the environment of the reviewed code (see question
52). It is possible to include different environments for an additional
fee.

<div class="faq-title">

68\. If I ask a question in the comment system,
how long does it take to get an answer?

</div>

All questions made through the vulnerabilities comment system, have a
`4` business hours `SLA`. M - F from `8AM` to `12` noon and `2PM` to
`6PM` (`UTC-5` Colombia = same as Eastern Standard Time `USA`). `SLA` is
not contractually defined, it is our value promise.

<div class="faq-title">

69\. Do you have liability insurance?

</div>

Yes, `1M USD` coverage.
