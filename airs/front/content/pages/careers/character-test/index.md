The next step in the selection process to become a part of the `Fluid
Attacks` team is taking a test that looks to quantify the 4 main
strengths that we look for in a candidate. Our philosophy is based on
putting together a very talented team in which ethics and respect are a
priority, where we will work to better your strengths instead of trying
to correct your weaknesses.

To continue with this step, we ask that you please follow the following
instructions:

1. Follow the link that will be sent to you via email once you finish
    the previous states.

    Or follow this
    [link](https://fluidattacks.formstack.com/forms/profile)

2. Follow the instructions on screen,

3. Once you are registered you can take the test in 8 minutes. There
    are 24 questions with a maximum of 20 seconds per question,

4. Once you have finished the test we will be able to see your 4 main
    strengths. Here are some suggestions for the test:

5. Once you start the test it cannot be paused nor repeated,

6. Make sure no interruptions occur during the test,

7. Trust your instinct,

8. There are no wrong answers,

9. The test results are always your 4 main strengths,

variable taken into account when making our decision.
