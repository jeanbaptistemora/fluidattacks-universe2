Fluid Attacks' Ethical Hacking solution
consists of attacking diverse systems
with the aim of discovering vulnerabilities
that could be exploited by malicious hackers
to generate significant damage to a company.
Our certified ethical hackers use methods and tools
in a similar way to unethical hackers.
However,
the difference is that our hackers first obtain your permission
and then attack your system
with the goal of helping you proactively look for
and understand the threats to your technology.
They do a reconnaissance of your IT infrastructure,
applications or source code
and try to get access and exploit flaws through ethical pentesting
to collect and analyze information
that can be useful to improve your organization's data protection.

Contrary to other ethical hacking services,
our solution is performed continuously
throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
This means you don't have to wait for professional hacker services
to check on the security of a product
just before it reaches its end users.
We guarantee ethical hacking attacks
that find complex vulnerabilities early
in a preventive way,
so that your development team can remediate them
before your software goes into production.

        our hackers can go at the pace of your company's developers,
        which is not possible with traditional hacking solutions.
        In this way,

## Ethical Hacking FAQs

<faq-container>

<div>
<solution-faq
  title="What does a certified ethical hacker do?">

A certified ethical hacker exerts their expertise
to discover everything that can pose a cybersecurity risk
within an IT system,
operating with the consent of its owners.
In their assessments,
they normally proceed in the same phases
a skilled threat actor would follow:
passive and active reconnaissance,
enumeration, analysis and exploitation.
In a later reporting phase,
ethical hackers present their findings,
which are valuable to trigger remediation efforts.
We offer plenty more details [here](../../blog/what-is-ethical-hacking/).

<div>
<solution-faq
  title="Why is ethical hacking important?">

Ethical hacking is important
because it anticipates attacks
that malicious actors would try to perform,
thus informing of the flaws in the system
that need to be remediated,
which are often more severe
than those found using only automated tools.
