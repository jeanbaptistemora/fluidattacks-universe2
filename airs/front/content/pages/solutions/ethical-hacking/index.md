solution: Fluid Attacks’ Ethical Hacking solution consists of attacking diverse systems with the aim of discovering vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious hackers to generate significant damage to a company. Our certified ethical hackers use methods and tools in a similar way to unethical hackers.

### Simultaneous assessment

Security in DevSecOps is as crucial as functionality. When it comes to
detecting and reporting vulnerabilities, our hackers can go at the pace
of your company’s developers. In this way, you save both money in
repairs and time in release to production.

### 10+ hackers assigned

With our solution, you are not paying for an automatic hacking process.
Rather than assigning only one professional to evaluate your IT systems’
security using an automated tool, at Fluid Attacks, Continuous Hacking
is usually performed by nearly 10 ethical or white hat hackers per
project.

### Price based on scope

Our cost is variable and proportional to the number of developers who
build and modify your code. In other words, the price you pay for our
Ethical Hacking solution will be proportional to your investment in
software development.
