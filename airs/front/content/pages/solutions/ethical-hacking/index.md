`Fluid Attacks'` Ethical Hacking solution
consists of attacking diverse systems
with the aim of discovering vulnerabilities
that could be exploited by malicious hackers
to generate significant damage to a company.
Our certified ethical hackers use methods and tools
in a similar way to unethical hackers.
However,
the difference is that our hackers first obtain your permission
and then they do a reconnaissance of your IT infrastructure,
applications or source code
and try to get access and exploit flaws through ethical pentesting
in order to collect and analyze information
that can be useful to improve your organization's data protection.

Contrary to other ethical hacking services,
our solution is performed continuously
throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
This means you don't have to wait for professional hacker services
to check on the security of a product
just before it reaches its end users.
We guarantee ethical hacking attacks
that find complex vulnerabilities early
in a preventive way,
so that your development team can remediate them
before your software goes into production.

If you're just beginning to learn
about what ethical hackers do,
we recommend you read our blog post
"[What Is Ethical Hacking?](../../blog/what-is-ethical-hacking/)"
It tells you the basics,
including the phases in the ethical hacking process.

<div class="sect2">

### Simultaneous security assessment

Security in DevSecOps is as crucial as functionality.
When it comes to detecting and reporting vulnerabilities,
our hackers can go at the pace of your company's developers,
which is not possible with traditional hacking solutions.
In this way,
you save both money in remediation
and time in release to production.

<div class="sect2">

### Report of critical severity vulnerabilities

Our latest research shows that
all of the critical severity vulnerabilities
in our clients' systems
were detected by the manual method only.
That is,
ethical hackers can find the vulnerabilities automated tools can't.

### 10 hackers assigned on average

With our solution,
you are not paying for a so-called "automatic hacking" process.
Rather than assigning only one professional
to evaluate your IT systems' security using an automated tool,
at `Fluid Attacks`,
Ethical Hacking is usually performed by 10 ethical or white hat hackers
on average per project.

</div>

<div class="sect2">

### Price of hacking based on scope

Our cost is variable and proportional
to the number of developers
who build and modify your code.
In other words,
the price you pay for our Ethical Hacking solution
will be proportional to your investment
in software development.

## Ethical hacking FAQs

The following are a few FAQs regarding ethical hacking:

### What does a certified ethical hacker do?

A certified ethical hacker exerts their expertise
to discover everything that can pose a cybersecurity risk
within an IT system,
operating with the consent of its owners.
In their assessments,
they normally proceed in the same phases
a skilled threat actor would follow:
passive and active reconnaissance,
enumeration, analysis and exploitation.
In a later reporting phase,
ethical hackers present their findings,
which are valuable to trigger remediation efforts.
We offer plenty more details [here](../../blog/what-is-ethical-hacking/).

### Why is ethical hacking important?

Ethical hacking is important
because it anticipates attacks
that malicious actors would try to perform,
thus informing of the flaws in the system
that need to be remediated,
which are often more severe
than those found using only automated tools.
