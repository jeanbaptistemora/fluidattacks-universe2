Simulating an attack scenario can be the best way
to discover whether an organization's information system
and defense staff
are ready to prevent, identify and respond to real threats.
Current malicious hackers and malware follow specific procedures
that our certified team of ethical hackers has the ability to understand
and implement in every controlled simulation.
Through our Breach and Attack Simulation solution,
in which our team strictly assumes the role of the attacker,
you will find out what the weaknesses of your company are
in terms of cybersecurity
and consequently make the first step
towards strengthening your IT systems' controls
and enhancing their security.

Organizations need to test the effectiveness of security controls
against new threats and hacking techniques.
We address this need
through our breach and attack simulation services
done by our highly certified ethical hackers
who are up to date in the tactics,
techniques and procedures of threat actors.

### Security testing that is close to reality

Our ethical hackers use simulated attacks
to bring your company closer to the reality
of potential cybersecurity problems.
Their findings can point to the necessary modifications to your systems
that should be made
in order to anticipate the actions of malicious hackers.

### Vulnerability exploitation

We can do exploitation
as long as we have an open environment
and your authorization.
After discovering a vulnerability and exploiting it,
we can show you the impacts on compromised records
such as users, passwords, wages, credit card numbers,
files on a hard disk, etc.

### Knowledge about the severity of vulnerabilities

A simulated attack allows us to know your systems' vulnerabilities
and classify them according to their severity
(critical ones tend to be given a high priority).
With the information we provide,
you can consider the possible impacts
of each vulnerability on your business
and make the necessary decisions
in order to keep your company secure.

## Breach and attack simulation FAQs

The following are a few FAQs regarding breach and attack simulation:

### What is breach and attack simulation?

This security testing method involves ethical hackers,
or pen testers,
assessing the effectiveness of the security controls of organizations
when confronted by the latest threat intelligence or adversarial tactics,
techniques and procedures.

### What is the end result of breach and attack simulation?

This life-like exercise reveals security vulnerabilities
and misconfigurations.
The result is a more realistic view
of the security of an organization's IT systems,
as well as its incident detection and response capabilities.
On the basis of these results,
your organization's security controls can be enhanced
so that they can withstand attacks by malicious hackers.
