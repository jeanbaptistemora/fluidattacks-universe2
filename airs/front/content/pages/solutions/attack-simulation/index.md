Simulating an attack scenario can be the best way
to discover whether an organization's information system
and defense staff
are ready to prevent, identify and respond to real threats.
Current malicious hackers and malware follow specific procedures
that our certified team of ethical hackers has the ability to understand
and implement in every controlled simulation.
Through our Breach and Attack Simulation solution,
in which our team strictly assumes the role of the attacker,
you will find out what the weaknesses of your company are
in terms of cybersecurity
and consequently make the first step
towards strengthening your IT systems' controls
and enhancing their security.

Organizations need to test the effectiveness of security controls
against new threats and hacking techniques.
We address this need
through our breach and attack simulation services
done by our highly certified ethical hackers
who are up to date in the tactics,
techniques and procedures of threat actors.
