solution: Simulating an attack scenario can be the best way
  to discover whether an organization’s information system
  and defense staff are ready to identify, respond to,
  and prevent real threats. Current malicious hackers and malware
  follow specific procedures which our certified team of ethical
  hackers has the ability to understand and implement in every
  controlled simulation. Through this solution, in which our
  team strictly assumes the role of the attacker, you will
  find out what the weaknesses of your company are in terms
  of cybersecurity, and consequently achieve the first step
  to strengthening your IT systems’ controls and enhancing their security.

### Close to reality

The ethical hacker uses simulated attacks to bring your company closer
to the reality of potential cybersecurity problems. Their work and
findings can motivate you to make the necessary modifications to your
systems in order to anticipate malicious hackers’ actions.

### Exploitation

We can do exploitation as long as we have an open environment and your
authorization. After discovering a vulnerability and exploiting it, we
can show you the impacts on compromised records such as users,
passwords, wages, credit card numbers, files on a hard disk, etc.

### Severity of vulnerabilities

A simulated attack allows us to know your systems’ vulnerabilities and
classify them according to their severity (critical ones tend to receive
a high priority). With the information we provide, you can consider the
possible impacts of each vulnerability on your business and make the
necessary decisions in order to keep your company secure.
