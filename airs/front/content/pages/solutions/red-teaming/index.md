Fluid Attacks is 100% a Red Team. Our core is testing
and attacking infrastructures, applications,
and source codes to find vulnerabilities that may pose risks
to the assets of the owners and users of those systems.
Our certified ethical hackers, continuously aiming
to discover and employ novel tools and approaches,
simulate cybercriminal attacks on your company’s information technology
to assess its security controls and status. Based on these findings,
we can then provide you with advice to determine the best ways
to resolve your systems’ weaknesses and improve
your protection against the countless,
constant internal and external threats in cybersecurity.
