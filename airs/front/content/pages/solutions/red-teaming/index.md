`Fluid Attacks` is 100% a red team.
We establish with your organization specific objectives
and set out to attack its systems and security controls
to find out the effectiveness of its attack prevention,
detection and response strategies.
The holistic nature of this approach means
it would often need for the personnel,
and not only the technology,
to also be put to the test (e.g., through social engineering).
This allows the red teaming simulation to be as close to reality as possible.
Also for this purpose,
our ethical hackers,
who hold several certifications in offensive security,
employ up-to-date tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP)
to simulate attacks
that cybercriminals may conduct against your organization.
Based on what they find,
we can then provide you with advice
to determine the best ways
to resolve your systems' weaknesses
and improve your protection against the countless,
constant internal and external threats in cybersecurity.

We have detailed information about red teaming in our blog.
If you want to understand the basics of this approach,
we recommend that you read our posts
"[What Is Red Team in Cyber Security?](../../blog/what-is-red-team-in-cyber-security/)"
and "[Red Team Exercise](../../blog/red-team-exercise/)."
Further,
to learn what policies we encourage you to create
in regard to testing your organization's response
to "real-world" cyberattacks,
read "[Attacking Without Announcing](../../blog/attacking-without-announcing/)."
We have also talked about the standard phases of red teaming
according to an initiative by the European Central Bank
in "[Have You Heard About the TIBER-EU?](../../blog/tiber-eu-framework/)"
And in "[TIBER Advice on Choosing Providers](../../blog/tiber-eu-providers/)"
we have summarized what this initiative says
about what you should look for
in those that offer red teaming services.

### Testing responses to "real-world" cyberattacks

`Fluid Attacks'` red team members emulate the tactics,
techniques and procedures of today's threat actors
and try to go unnoticed
to test your organization's security.
These exercises are holistic
in that they assess the effectiveness of security strategies
both at the technological and human level.

## Red teaming FAQs

The following are a few FAQs regarding red teaming:

### What is red team in cyber security?

A red team is a group of offensive security specialists
that simulates cyberattacks against the same organizations that employ it,
targeting not only their IT systems but also their employees
and security controls in their physical facilities.

### What is red team and blue team in cyber security?

Whereas a red team is a group of experts
that conducts offensive attacks to realize specific objectives,
a blue team is a group of defensive security specialists
whose job is to assess the target organization's security
and organize, implement and improve controls
that would help fend it from the red team and other attackers.

### What is a red team exercise?

Red team exercises are attack simulations
where the red team advances offensively toward specific objectives
agreed upon between them and the target organization,
who,
in turn,
must respond defensively.
The red team simulations are done with the consent
of the organization's executive leadership,
although,
ideally,
the incident response team,
employees and security staff do not know this.
