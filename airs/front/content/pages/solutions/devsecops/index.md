We offer the integration of security
into the development + operations (DevOps) methodology
during the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
As opposed to many DevSecOps solutions,
at `Fluid Attacks`,
we are not entirely dependent on tools
and place more value on our ethical hackers' skills
to ensure greater accuracy in testing.
We recognize that speed without precision is useless.

Our security solutions in your DevSecOps integration
can help optimize your development process
from the first uploaded commit
and continue doing so after the software is in production.
You can rely on us
to discover how exposed your systems are to risk.
We do this through penetration testing,
reverse engineering
and automated methods such as SAST,
SCA and DAST.
DevSecOps with `Fluid Attacks` is a cultural change
within your organization
where every team member can become convinced
that security is everyone's responsibility.

Are you just introducing your company to DevSecOps
or want to learn more about this approach?
We invite you to read in our blog
a whole series of posts focused on DevSecOps:
You can start with "[What Is DevSecOps?](../../blog/devsecops-concept/)"
There,
you will understand the difference between this concept and DevOps,
what makes this practice necessary today,
how it works and much more.
Then you can move on to the post "[How to Implement DevSecOps](../../blog/how-to-implement-devsecops/),"
which gives you a strategy
for adopting this methodology in your organization.
You may also want to read our post
on how we combine the advantages of automated tools
and manual security testing,
"[Our DevSecOps Tools](../../blog/devsecops-tools/)."
Later you can learn about some actions
to keep this culture going
in "[DevSecOps Best Practices](../../blog/devsecops-best-practices/)."
Finally,
we offer "[What Does a DevSecOps Engineer Do?](../../blog/what-does-a-devsecops-engineer-do/)"
In it,
you can learn about the skills,
responsibilities and certifications of these professionals,
leaders of this security movement
that covers your entire SDLC.

## Benefits

</div>

<div class="flex flex-wrap justify-center items-center">

<div class="sect2">

### Optimal integration

Our security testing,
integrating DevSecOps techniques
such as SAST, DAST and SCA,
supports your whole software development process
while ensuring smooth communication between our red team
and your developers.

</div>

<div class="sect2">

### DevSecOps DAST, SAST and SCA

DAST assesses your applications in execution
for security issues related to deployment configuration,
business logic and data.
SAST scans static code
to identify coding and design errors
that lead to weaknesses.
And SCA focuses on vulnerabilities in third-party components
used by your product.
We apply these techniques continuously while you develop.

</div>

<div class="sect2">

### Manual and precise work

In our DevSecOps solution,
security testing goes beyond the use of automated tools
to leverage ethical hackers expertise
and discover everything
that can pose a cybersecurity risk within your IT systems.
This allows us to guarantee
very low rates of false positives and false negatives
in our projects.

</div>

<div class="sect2">

### Legacy languages and methods

We hack legacy applications coded in old-established languages,
including COBOL, RPG, PL1 and TAL.
In addition,
we integrate
with any development method
such as Waterfall, Agile and DevOps.

</div>

<div class="sect2">

### Early detection

Vulnerabilities in your code are quickly identified
at early development stages.
This is because
our continuous hacking advances simultaneously with the developers' work.

</div>

<div class="sect2">

### DevSecOps vulnerability management

As security assessments advance,
you receive detailed reports continually
in our Attack Resistance Management platform.
This facilitates your understanding of your systems' risk exposure,
the prioritization of vulnerabilities for remediation,
and tracking progress within your organization.

</div>

<div class="sect2">

### Break the build

At `Fluid Attacks`,
we have a **DevSecOps agent** to break the build.
Within our DevSecOps solution,
we can break the build
in any continuous integration pipeline
without making the mistake of doing so
with false positives or lies.

</div>

<div class="sect2">

### High remediation rates

At `Fluid Attacks`,
we help you ensure high vulnerability remediation rates
in your IT systems.
By breaking the build in the continuous integration pipeline,
we can encourage you
to quickly repair those weaknesses
that can generate severe impacts to your business.
