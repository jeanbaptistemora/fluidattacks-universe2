solution: We offer the integration of security into the development +
  operations (DevOps) methodology during Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).
  In DevSecOps, all team members involved in software development become
  responsible for security. As opposed to other companies’ approach,
  at Fluid Attacks, we are not entirely dependent on tools and place more value
  on our ethical hackers’ skills to ensure greater accuracy in testing.
  We recognize that speed without precision is useless. Our security
  solutions can help optimize your development process from the first
  uploaded commit and continue after the application is in production.

### Optimal integration

Our security testing, integrating techniques such as SAST, DAST, IAST
and SCA, supports your whole software development process while ensuring
smooth communication between our red team and your developers.

### Manual and precise work

At Fluid Attacks, our hackers go beyond using automated tools, using
their expertise to discover everything that can pose a cybersecurity
risk within your IT systems. This allows us to guarantee minimal rates
of false positives and false negatives in our projects.

### Legacy languages and methods

We hack legacy applications coded in old-established languages,
including COBOL, RPG, PL1 and TAL. In addition, we integrate with any
development method such as Waterfall, Agile and DevOps.

### Early detection

Confirmed vulnerabilities in the code are quickly identified at early
development stages. This is because our continuous hacking advances
simultaneously with the developers’ work.

### High remediation rates

At Fluid Attacks, we help you ensure high vulnerability remediation
rates in your IT systems. By breaking the build in the continuous
integration pipeline, we can encourage you to quickly repair those
weaknesses that can generate severe impacts on your business.

### Break the build

At Fluid Attacks, within our DevSecOps solution, we can break the build
in any continuous integration pipeline to prevent going to production
with unrepaired vulnerabilities.
