`Fluid Attacks` Security Testing solution
allows for the accurate detection of security vulnerabilities
in your IT infrastructure,
applications and source code.
While other security testing solutions focus on applying a single method,
`Fluid Attacks` offers comprehensive assessments through SAST,
DAST and SCA.
Further,
we depend less on tools
and rely heavily on human expertise instead:
Our security testing team consists of certified ethical hackers
who work in diverse environments
to perform reverse engineering,
manual penetration testing and exploitation.
Our approach allows us to deliver reports
that contain minimal rates of false positives and false negatives.

We conduct security testing continuously,
early
and throughout the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC).
You can find all the results of our assessments
along with helpful details
on `Fluid Attacks'` Attack Resistance Management platform (ARM).
Among this information,
our security analysts provide you with recommendations and guidance
on their remediation
in order to mitigate the risks of cyberattacks
from internal and external sources.
Every time you have implemented the fixes,
you can ask us to perform reattacks
to assess their effectiveness.

We have several blog posts
where you can learn the basics
about the security testing techniques we use at `Fluid Attacks`.
"[Sastisfying App Security](../../blog/sastisfying-app-security/)"
and "[Stand on the Shoulders of Giants](../../blog/stand-shoulders-giants/)"
give you a basic introduction to SAST and SCA,
respectively.
Further,
you can read "[How do SAST, SCA and DAST differ?](../../blog/differences-between-sast-sca-dast/),"
where we talk about combining these different techniques
for comprehensive security testing.
"[Opening the Program's Box](../../blog/reverse-engineering/)"
shares general ideas about software reverse engineering.
"[Penetration Testing as a Service](../../blog/what-is-ptaas/)"
presents how pentesting is being used continuously
to keep up with the speed of software development.
Also,
to learn how all the above is used to test mobile applications,
read "[What's Mobile App Security Testing?](../../blog/what-is-mast/)"

### Vulnerability report

Our certified team of ethical hackers actively searches your systems
for cybersecurity vulnerabilities
that may pose a risk to your information assets
and those of your users.
You will receive detailed reports
based on which you can decide what you want to fix
according to the severity and impact on your business.

<div class="sect2">

### Minimal rates of false positives

We place much more emphasis on tool-supported manual work
than on the use of automatic tools alone,
and are more concerned with accuracy than speed.
This is why you will find very low rates of false positives and false negatives
in our projects.

### Centralized management

We manage the security testing from a unique point,
our ARM.
This allows our red team to be available
and in constant communication with your developers
in order to achieve high remediation rates.
We also use this platform to provide you with easy-to-understand,
real-time executive indicators.
