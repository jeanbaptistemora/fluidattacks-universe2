`Fluid Attacks` Security Testing solution
allows for the accurate detection of security vulnerabilities
in your IT infrastructure,
applications and source code.
While other security testing solutions focus on applying a single method,
`Fluid Attacks` offers comprehensive assessments through SAST,
DAST and SCA.
Further,
we depend less on tools
and rely heavily on human expertise instead:
Our security testing team consists of certified ethical hackers
who work in diverse environments
to perform reverse engineering,
manual penetration testing and exploitation.
Our approach allows us to deliver reports
that contain minimal rates of false positives and false negatives.

We conduct security testing continuously,
early
and throughout the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC).
You can find all the results of our assessments
along with helpful details
on `Fluid Attacks'` Attack Resistance Management platform (ARM).
Among this information,
our security analysts provide you with recommendations
and guidance on their remediation
in order to mitigate the risks of cyberattacks
from internal and external sources.
Every time you have implemented the fixes,
you can ask us to perform reattacks
to assess their effectiveness.

We have several blog posts
where you can learn the basics
about the security testing techniques we use at `Fluid Attacks`.
"[Sastisfying App Security](../../blog/sastisfying-app-security/)"
and "[Stand on the Shoulders of Giants](../../blog/stand-shoulders-giants/)"
give you a basic introduction to SAST and SCA,
respectively.
Further,
you can read "[How do SAST, SCA and DAST differ?](../../blog/differences-between-sast-sca-dast/),"
where we talk about combining these different techniques
for comprehensive security testing.
"[Opening the Program's Box](../../blog/reverse-engineering/)"
shares general ideas about software reverse engineering.
"[Penetration Testing as a Service](../../blog/what-is-ptaas/)"
presents how pentesting is being used continuously
to keep up with the speed of software development.
Also,
to learn how all the above is used to test mobile applications,
read "[What's Mobile App Security Testing?](../../blog/what-is-mast/)"

<div class="sect2">

### Continuous attack surface testing

Our comprehensive Security Testing solution involves delivering attacks
continuously
to all the points from which unauthorized entry could be gained.
This way,
you can keep the security of all your digital assets monitored.

</div>

<div class="sect2">

### Exhaustive vulnerability reports

Our certified team of ethical hackers actively searches your systems
for cybersecurity vulnerabilities
that may pose a risk to your information assets
and those of your users.
You will receive detailed reports
based on which you can decide what you want to fix
according to the severity and impact on your business.

</div>

<div class="sect2">

### Minimal rates of false positives

We place much more emphasis on tool-supported manual work
than on the use of automatic tools alone,
and are more concerned with accuracy than speed.
This is why you will find very low rates of false positives and false negatives
in our projects.

### Centralized attack surface management

We manage the security testing from a unique point,
our ARM.
This allows our red team to be available
and in constant communication with your developers
in order to achieve high remediation rates.
We also use this platform to provide you with easy-to-understand,
up-to-date executive indicators.

## Security testing FAQs

The following are a few FAQs regarding security testing:

### How to perform security testing?

Security testing should be comprehensive
and performed continuously throughout the entire SDLC.
Depending on the phase,
some methods will be more appropriate than others.
So,
for example,
SAST is advised from the code phase onward,
SCA from the building phase onward,
DAST from the testing phase onward,
and so on.
The application of these methods
should not rely exclusively on automated tools.
They should also be performed
and reviewed for accuracy manually.
After remediating vulnerabilities,
security testing should be performed again
to verify the effectiveness of the remediation
and find new vulnerabilities.

### Do automated tools hack?

We argue that no tool hacks.
Even though suites have been invented
to run particular exploits
(i.e., code strings that have been proven to take advantage of a vulnerability)
also written by hackers,
there always needs to be a human behind these tools
who knows which exploit to use in any given context.

### How do false positives impact the software development process?

False positives can be a hindrance
as their analysis can be time consuming and frustrating.
Moreover,
developers may start to lose confidence
in the reports generated by the security testing tool or method.
Also,
if it is within an organization's policy to break the build
(i.e., to interrupt the delivery of vulnerable code to production),
false positives can be a false alarm
that triggers this action,
resulting in setbacks for development.

### How do false negatives impact the software development process?

False negatives can contribute to an organization's false sense of security.
Moreover,
moving into production with these vulnerabilities means
that malicious attackers could exploit them,
and remediation costs would be higher than in development phases.
