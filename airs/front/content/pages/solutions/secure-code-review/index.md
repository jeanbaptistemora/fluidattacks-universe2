`Fluid Attacks'` Secure Code Review solution
provides you with a comprehensive review of your software's source code.
Specifically,
this solution is intended to identify
whether your lines of code are following required coding standards
and whether there are security flaws or vulnerabilities
that need to be remediated promptly
to prevent any cyberattack.
We employ a diverse set of security testing techniques,
including SAST and SCA,
always using a combination of automatic and manual processes
to achieve these objectives.
Through our comprehensive secure code review methodology,
we minimize false negatives
and deliver reports with very low rates of false positives.

Contrary to common practice,
the Secure Code Review solution is applied to your applications' code
from the early stages of the software development lifecycle (SDLC)
and at a continuous pace.
This means our solution offers an advantage
over traditional secure code review services,
prompting you to reduce security risks before the software is released,
thus avoiding future costs of remediation.
