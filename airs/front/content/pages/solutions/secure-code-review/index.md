solution: Fluid Attacks’ Secure Code Review solution provides you
  with a comprehensive review of your software’s source code. Specifically,
  this solution is intended to identify whether your lines of code are
  following required coding standards and whether there are security
  flaws or vulnerabilities that need to be remediated promptly to prevent
  any cyberattack. We employ a diverse set of security testing techniques,
  including SAST and SCA, always using a combination of automatic and manual
  processes to achieve these objectives. Contrary to common practice,
  the Secure Code Review solution should be applied to your applications’ code
  from the early stages of the Software Development Lifecycle and
  at a continuous pace, reducing security risks before the software is
  released and avoiding future costs of remediation.
