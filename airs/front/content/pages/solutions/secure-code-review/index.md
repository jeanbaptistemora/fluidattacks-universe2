`Fluid Attacks'` Secure Code Review solution
provides you with a comprehensive review of your software's source code.
Specifically,
this solution is intended to identify
whether your lines of code are following required coding standards
and whether there are security flaws or vulnerabilities
that need to be remediated promptly
to prevent any cyberattack.
We employ a diverse set of security testing techniques,
including SAST and SCA,
always using a combination of automatic and manual processes
to achieve these objectives.
Through our comprehensive secure code review methodology,
we minimize false negatives
and deliver reports with very low rates of false positives.

Contrary to common practice,
the Secure Code Review solution is applied to your applications' code
from the early stages of the software development lifecycle (SDLC)
and at a continuous pace.
This means our solution offers an advantage
over traditional secure code review services,
prompting you to reduce security risks before the software is released,
thus avoiding future costs of remediation.

<div class="sect2">

### Updated source code security

Early and constant secure source code review can allow the system,
in general,
to maintain updated and secure components,
that is,
to follow all kinds of trends in cybersecurity
in favor of the integrity
and confidentiality of the information.

<div class="sect2">

### Accurate security assessments

Our Secure Code Review solution offers a combination
of the advantages of secure code review tools
and manual code review.
This approach allows for an accurate examination
of your software's source code structure and functionality
in order to detect every type of error and weakness,
so you can then diligently remedy them
to ensure code quality and security.

### Full tracking of vulnerabilities in code

Our Attack Resistance Management platform (ARM)
allows you to access general
and specific data for each finding in your code
reported by our expert security analysts.
Furthermore, it enables your team
to follow the entire vulnerability remediation process with detailed,
up-to-date information.

### Secure coding compliance assessments

We check that you comply with best practices laid out in secure coding guides
by reliable sources such as the OWASP.

## Secure code review FAQs

The following are a few FAQs regarding secure code review:

### How to do code review?

Your team should be reviewing source code
from the very moment they start writing it.
The main goal is to reduce the risk of successful cyberattacks
due to code vulnerabilities that emerge during the development cycle.
The source code review process should be constant
and involve a combination of scanning by automated tool
and manual assessments
so that every vulnerability is found and properly confirmed.
Automation helps find known and simple vulnerabilities,
saving time for security analysts,
while the manual technique helps examine the code in context and intention
to identify unknown and complex vulnerabilities
and validate the tool scan results.

### What security requirements do you check when doing source code review?

At `Fluid Attacks`,
we compile our own
list of requirements —which are written as specific objectives— upon revision
of several international standards related to information security.
Among these standards are
the OWASP Secure Coding Practices Reference Guide (OWASP SCP),
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).
Some of the requirements we check are:
removing commented-out code,
excluding unverifiable files (e.g., binaries),
verifying that the versions of third-party components in use are stable,
tested and up to date,
and many others.
