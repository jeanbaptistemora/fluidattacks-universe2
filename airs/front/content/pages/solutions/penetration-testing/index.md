`Fluid Attacks'` comprehensive Penetration Testing solution
is based on our certified pentesters' ability
to simulate real-world cyberattacks
in order to infiltrate companies' software and information assets.
Our pentesters look for
and try to exploit security vulnerabilities in your systems
and then provide you with detailed reports
that can assist you in their proper elimination.

Contrary to other penetration testing solutions,
our pentesting is not an automated activity.
`Fluid Attacks'` professionals make use of security
and penetration testing tools
and rely on their expertise
to apply manual security testing techniques.
Therefore,
this kind of testing focuses much more on vulnerabilities
that cannot be discovered through automated scanning methods,
which are oriented to find known weaknesses.
Our hackers know the latest and most intricate techniques
threat actors use to attack,
and penetration testing is the perfect way to find out
whether your system is effectively secured against them.

Are you new to manual pentesting?
We invite you to read the blog posts we have written on the matter.
"[Penetration Testing as a Service](../../blog/what-is-ptaas/)"
introduces you to manual pen testing
and the delivery model that applies this technique
throughout the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC).
"[The Importance of Pentesting](../../blog/importance-pentesting/)"
exposes the disadvantages of automated vulnerability analysis
in regards to what shines the brightest
in manual penetration testing: simulation of real attack scenarios.
Further,
"[Choosing the Right Pentesting Team](../../blog/choosing-pentesting-team/)"
offers key attributes to consider
when choosing among service providers to evaluate your systems.

<div class="sect2">

### In-depth hacking

Our ethical hackers' extensive efforts allow them to know in greater detail
the vulnerabilities in the systems they assess
and what risks are being taken
if these flaws are not promptly remediated.

</div>

<div class="sect2">

### Manual and precise work

Our ethical hackers go beyond using automated tools,
exerting their expertise
to discover everything that can pose a cybersecurity risk
within your IT systems.
This is how we can guarantee very low rates of false positives
and false negatives in our projects.

<div class="sect2">

### Enhanced security

You can have an updated status of your systems' security
through continuous penetration testing,
which then enables you
to remediate vulnerabilities before cybercriminals find them.

### Multiple reattacks

Every time you remediate a vulnerability
we find in your system through Continuous Hacking,
you can ask our team to verify that remediation.
This verification process does not have any additional cost,
no matter how many reattacks are necessary.
