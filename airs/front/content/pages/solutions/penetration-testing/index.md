solution: Fluid Attacks’ comprehensive Penetration Testing is based on our certified pentesters’ ability to simulate real-world cyberattacks in order to infiltrate companies’ software and information assets. Our pentesters look for and try to exploit security vulnerabilities in your systems and then provide you with detailed reports for their proper elimination. Pentesting is not an automated activity; the professionals make use of security and penetration testing tools as well as relying on their expertise to apply manual techniques. Therefore, this kind of testing focuses more on vulnerabilities that cannot be discovered through automated scanning methods that are more oriented to known weaknesses.
