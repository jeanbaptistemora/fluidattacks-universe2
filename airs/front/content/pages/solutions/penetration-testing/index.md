`Fluid Attacks'` comprehensive Penetration Testing solution
is based on our certified pentesters' ability
to simulate real-world cyberattacks
in order to infiltrate companies' software and information assets.
Our pentesters look for and try to exploit security vulnerabilities
in your systems
and then provide you with detailed reports
that can assist you in their proper elimination.

Contrary to other penetration testing solutions,
our pentesting is not an automated activity.
`Fluid Attacks'` professionals make use of security
and penetration testing tools
and rely on their expertise
to apply manual security testing techniques.
Therefore,
this kind of testing focuses much more on vulnerabilities
that cannot be discovered through automated scanning methods,
which are oriented to find known weaknesses.
Our hackers know the latest and most intricate techniques
threat actors use to attack,
and penetration testing is the perfect way to find out
whether your system is effectively secured against them.

Are you new to manual pentesting?
We invite you to read the blog posts we have written on the matter.
"[Penetration Testing as a Service](../../blog/what-is-ptaas/)"
introduces you to manual pen testing
and the delivery model that applies this technique
throughout the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC).
"[The Importance of Pentesting](../../blog/importance-pentesting/)"
exposes the disadvantages of automated vulnerability analysis
in regards to what shines the brightest
in manual penetration testing: simulation of real attack scenarios.
Further,
"[Choosing the Right Pentesting Team](../../blog/choosing-pentesting-team/)"
offers key attributes to consider
when choosing among service providers to evaluate your systems.

## Benefits of Penetration Testing

</div>

<div class="flex flex-wrap justify-center items-center">

<div class="sect2">

### In-depth hacking

Our ethical hackers' extensive efforts allow them to know in greater detail
the vulnerabilities in the systems they assess
and what risks are being taken
if these flaws are not promptly remediated.

</div>

<div class="sect2">

### Manual and precise security testing

Our ethical hackers go beyond using automated tools,
exerting their expertise
to discover everything that can pose a cybersecurity risk
within your IT systems.
This is how we can guarantee very low rates of false positives
and false negatives in our projects.

</div>

<div class="sect2">

### Enhanced cybersecurity

You can have an updated status of your systems' security
through continuous penetration testing,
which then enables you
to remediate vulnerabilities before cybercriminals find them.

</div>

<div class="sect2">

### Multiple reattacks

Every time you remediate a vulnerability
we find in your system through Continuous Hacking,
you can ask our team to verify that remediation.
This verification process does not have any additional cost,
no matter how many reattacks are necessary.

## Penetration testing FAQs

The following are a few FAQs regarding penetration testing:

### What is penetration testing?

It is the simulation of genuine attacks
to test the security of a system with the permission of its owners.
This method often involves creating custom exploits
with the goal of bypassing defenses.
That is why
it can be as accurate
as the skills of the ethical hackers performing it allow it to be.

### What is the primary purpose of penetration testing?

It is to find business-critical vulnerabilities in information systems
by using the same techniques and way of thinking of malicious hackers.

### What is the end result of a penetration test?

Penetration tests reveal complex vulnerabilities
that are often more severe than those found by automated tools alone.
The result is a more realistic view of the security of information systems.
If it is performed continuously and early in the SDLC,
as we do not tire of recommending,
then you can eliminate spots through which malicious hackers could get in
before moving into production.
