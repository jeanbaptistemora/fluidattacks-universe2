### Coverage

Ethical hacking can be done to achieve specific, full or variable
coverage. Specific coverage refers to a system where its overall size
can be assessed (application fields, lines of code, open ports) and you
choose to cover only a specific percentage. When you choose to cover the
entire system, that is full coverage. Variable coverage refers to a
system where its overall size cannot be assessed and a specific scope is
predefined.

### Critical Information Extraction and Information Removal

Information extraction is done to maximize the impacts of the findings.
The data gathered during a project remains on our **Attack Surface
Manager (ASM)**. Your project’s admin is allowed to delete it. The data
is removed **30** days after the admin’s decision. This operation can be
reversed during those **30** days. In that time, no user (even the
admin) has access to the project’s data unless the operation is
reversed.

### Severity of Tested Requirements

For every hacking process, you can be aware of its severity. Besides,
you can choose all the security requirements to be tested that you
consider necessary. Each requirement can be found and understood using
[**Criteria**](https://docs.fluidattacks.com/criteria/).

### Hacking Techniques, Team, Duration and Cycle

It is possible to perform ethical hacking of the source code, the
application or the infrastructure. You can choose the hacking technique
that best suits the needs of your business to meet the required security
assessment of each system. One-shot hacking, performed with manual
testing and use of tools by Fluid Attacks’ certified hackers, seeks to
attack a single version of your application. Therefore, it has only one
inspection cycle on the selected system. The duration depends on the
size of the **ToE** attack surface. Once all the requirements for
starting the project have been met, each attack will have a defined
start and end date.

### Infection

Whenever findings allow it, the infrastructure is infected with
malicious files. This process is carried out to gain extra data, infect
servers, and verify network controls. We use **Shells** and
cyber-weapons with the prior authorization of the client.

### Delivery of Reports and Validation / Presentation Meetings

Final reports are all-inclusive (evidence of risks, remediation, etc.).
These are given to the clients via a safe file transfer website. Each
ethical hacking test includes a remote meeting with the technical team
of the client to verify the reports. All stakeholders in the project can
take part when there is a formal presentation of the executive report.

</div>

### Attack Surface Manager

You can check the status of findings during the execution of the project
using **ASM**. Each project must have a leader so that he or she can
express the needs of your company before, during, and after the
performance. Daily progress reports are sent by email. These include
coverage, strictness, partial results, and overall progress.
