=== How can Fluid Attacks help with PCI DSS compliance?

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
Ensuring compliance with up-to-date security standards may become a complicated
issue for diverse organizations that use continually evolving information
technology for their businesses. Fluid Attacks recognizes this and offers you
comprehensive testing and analysis to determine whether your company is
effectively complying with all corresponding security requirements.

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
Although Fluid Attacks’ link:../../services/continuous-hacking/[Continuous Hacking, role=basic-link] service goes beyond the PCI DSS,
testing around 200 technical security requirements in each of your projects,
we can guarantee the detection of all vulnerabilities
in your software associated with this standard.
In addition, we provide you with reliable reports so that your
team can take the necessary steps to adjust and maintain your information
systems in line with such requirements.
We allow you to avoid penalties and, above all,
guarantee secure systems for customers or users,
thus ensuring their continued trust.

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
All our security testing is based on link:https://docs.fluidattacks.com/criteria/[Criteria, role=basic-link],
which is a set of security requirements
written by us in a comprehensible manner, using several
international standards as a reference. It allows you to parameterize the
assessments we make to your systems and determine what your company agrees to
comply with and what would be considered a vulnerability.

=== What is PCI DSS?

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
The Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (link:https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/about_us/[PCI SSC, role=basic-link]) is a global
organization created in 2006 by several well-known credit card companies to
develop and promote the adoption of security standards in the payment industry
worldwide. The set of standards established is called PCI Data Security
Standard (link:https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library?category=pcidss&document=pci_dss[PCI DSS, role=basic-link]), with the latest version published in 2018.
Looking for the prevention of frauds,
PCI DSS establishes the minimum requirements that
any company oriented towards storing, handling or transferring cardholder
information (e.g., payment account number, cardholder name) must satisfy.

=== What is PCI DSS compliance?

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
PCI DSS applies to online stores or e-commerce sites,
and even to businesses with the credit card payment option
available thanks to third-party services such as PayPal.
These standards and the scope of compliance may show differences
according to the activities (including volume of transactions)
performed by each company involved in the processing of cardholder data.
If this kind of information turns out to be stolen,
or the requirements are simply not met,
although PCI is not a government agency, companies must respond to sanctions.
These penalties may include large fines (from thousands to millions of dollars)
and even loss of the privilege of accepting card payment, not to mention the
implications on the customers’ trust and the company’s reputation.

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
Here is the list of requirements against which PCI DSS compliance is validated
(for specifications on requirements, sub-requirements and security assessment
procedures, please access the official document, link:https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library?category=pcidss&document=pci_dss[Version 3.2.1, May 2018, role=basic-link]):

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
1. Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data.
2. Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other
security parameters.
3. Protect stored cardholder data.
4. Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks.
5. Protect all systems against malware
and regularly update anti-virus software or programs.
6. Develop and maintain secure systems and applications.
7. Restrict access to cardholder data by business need to know.
8. Identify and authenticate access to system components.
9. Restrict physical access to cardholder data.
10. Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data.
11. Regularly test security systems and processes.
12. Maintain a policy that addresses information security for all personnel.

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
PCI DSS compliance must be an ongoing process that involves identifying which
cardholder information assets are being used, as well as under what procedures,
before analyzing them forsecurity vulnerabilities.
It must also include the remediation of those vulnerabilities
in order to shrink the attack surface and
the sharing of subsequent corresponding documentation,
i.e., compliance reports, with the banking companies concerned.
Additionally, organizations should constantly monitor potential threats,
perform penetration testing and receive advice
from experts to confirm this standard’s compliance.
