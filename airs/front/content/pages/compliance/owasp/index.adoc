=== How can Fluid Attacks help with OWASP compliance?

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
Ensuring compliance with up-to-date security standards may become a complicated
issue for diverse organizations that use continually evolving information
technology for their businesses.
Fluid Attacks recognizes this and offers you comprehensive testing and analysis
to determine whether your company is effectively complying with all
corresponding security requirements.

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
Although Fluid Attacks’ link:../../services/continuous-hacking/[Continuous Hacking, role=basic-link] service goes beyond the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risk,
testing around 200 technical security requirements in each of your projects,
we can guarantee the detection of all vulnerabilities
in your software associated with such risks.
In addition, we provide you with reliable reports
so that your team can take the necessary steps
to adjust and maintain your information systems in line with such requirements.

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
All our security testing is based on link:https://docs.fluidattacks.com/criteria/[Criteria, role=basic-link],
which is a set of security requirements
written by us in a comprehensible manner,
using several international standards as a reference.
It allows you to parameterize the assessments
we make to your systems and determine what your company agrees to comply with
and what would be considered a vulnerability.

=== What is the OWASP?

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
The Open Web Application Security Project (link:https://owasp.org/[OWASP, role=basic-link]), of which Fluid Attacks is a
corporate member, is a non-profit foundation that through different means of
communication is committed to improving the security of software.
The OWASP works as an online, open community where anyone can contribute to the
production of material in the field of web application security and also take
advantage of the available information. Their repository is useful for companies
that develop or manage web applications, since it relies on the knowledge of
many global community members with extensive experience in cybersecurity.

=== What is the OWASP Top 10?

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
The OWASP Top 10 refers to a cybersecurity guide by the OWASP community that is
created in agreement between experts and serves both developers and security
professionals in their projects. This guide, with a link:https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/​[current version from 2017, role=basic-link],
lists the ten most common and critical security risks in web applications and
provides practical information for their prevention or remediation.

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
The idea with this ranking is to help reduce the presence of flaws
in web applications that can be easily exploited and generate terrible impact.
Organizations should always be careful
not to bring into production applications
with vulnerabilities related to these security risks, making sure to pay
attention to the most prevalent risks in their specific industry sector.
Here we show you the current list of risks with a brief description of each one
(for more information see the link:https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/[official report, role=basic-link]):

[role="owasp-col fl"]
==== Injection

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
link:https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A1_2017-Injection[A code injection, role=basic-link] occurs when an application does not properly validate or
sanitize input and this can be leveraged to make it process the input as code.

[role="owasp-col fr"]
==== Broken Authentication

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
link:https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A2_2017-Broken_Authentication[Attackers can take, role=basic-link] advantage of misconfigured session
authentication and management functions in the applications and compromise
passwords, sessions, and even entire systems.

[role="owasp-col fl"]
==== Sensitive Data Exposure

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
link:https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A3_2017-Sensitive_Data_Exposure[This problem occurs, role=basic-link] when applications do not have sufficient
protection for sensitive data (e.g., financial data), leaving it publicly
accessible or without adequate access controls that prevent attackers from
obtaining it for illegal activities.

[role="owasp-col fr"]
==== XML External Entities (XXE)

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
link:https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A4_2017-XML_External_Entities_(XXE)[In this case, role=basic-link], attackers exploit weak configurations in a
web application that parses XML input
but does not properly handle references to
external entities, which can be used to exfiltrate documents, execute code
remotely or perform denial-of-service attacks.

[role="owasp-col fl"]
==== Broken Access Control

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
link:https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A5_2017-Broken_Access_Control[Web applications need, role=basic-link] to establish limits for the access to data
and functions depending on the type of user. Here, the attackers circumvent
misconfigured (sometimes simply non-existent) access restrictions and can
operate as any user, including administrators.

[role="owasp-col fr"]
==== Security Misconfiguration

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
link:https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A6_2017-Security_Misconfiguration[This misconfiguration refers, role=basic-link] to the inappropriate implementation of controls
for the application’s security, resulting in the exposure of error messages
containing sensitive data and the use of non-updated systems or components.

[role="owasp-col fl"]
==== Cross-Site Scripting XSS

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
link:https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A7_2017-Cross-Site_Scripting_(XSS)[Attackers can inject, role=basic-link] client-side scripts into the web application
to change its behavior, modify what is displayed to the users
or redirect the users to malicious websites.

[role="owasp-col fr"]
==== Insecure Deserialization

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
link:https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A8_2017-Insecure_Deserialization[Deserialization, the opposite, role=basic-link] process to serialization, consists in converting
strings of bytes into data structures that the application can use.
Deserialization weaknesses allow the attacker to execute code
in the web application remotely and manipulate serialized objects as desired.

[role="owasp-col fl"]
==== Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
link:https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A9_2017-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities[Web applications commonly, role=basic-link] use various open-source and third-party components in
which vulnerabilities are sometimes found and need to be patched. Keeping
outdated versions of those components with known
vulnerabilities leads to having an application exposed to exploitation.

[role="owasp-col fr"]
==== Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
link:https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A10_2017-Insufficient_Logging%2526Monitoring[Many companies do, role=basic-link] not frequently log and monitor their applications’ activities.
Usually, data breaches are detected after months, when the attackers have
already done a lot of damage.

=== OWASP Benchmark Project v1.2

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
Our SAST tool achieved the best possible result against the OWASP Benchmark:
A TPR (True Positive Rate) of 100% and an FPR (False Positive Rate) of 0%.
