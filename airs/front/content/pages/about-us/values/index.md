## 1\. Purpose and Scope

Please read this page carefully and completely. It sets forth ``Fluid
Attacks’ expectations
regarding how our employees, partners, allies, and customers
interact in our mutual business environment.
`Fluid Attacks`` is committed to maintaining a high degree of
professionalism, integrity, reliability, and ethics with the expectation
that those involved act in accordance with the law and company policies.
Understanding our expectations and compliance with them is expected at
all levels of our interaction. Failure to meet the principles set forth
here could result in penalties and/or criminal sanctions and the
termination of all business relations with `Fluid Attacks`.

## 2\. Principles

`Fluid Attacks` is a Colombian company. We firmly believe in, and
conduct business in accordance with, our principles. Our principles,
therefore, are not negotiable.

Our principles are:

1. **HONESTY:** At `Fluid Attacks` honesty is paramount in all our
    business interactions. Truthfulness, trustworthiness, reliability,
    and integrity is what we bring to our business relationships and
    what we expect in return.

2. The **TEAM:** ``Fluid Attacks’ results are achieved
    through the collaborative effort of all our staff.
    We are a team. Therefore, we maintain, and expect,
    dignified and respectful treatment
    for all members of the `Fluid Attacks`` team.

3. **DISCIPLINE:** `Fluid Attacks` will fulfill all our commitments
    with dedication, perseverance and `100%` focus on excellence for all
    our customers.

## 3\. Manifestations

Following are some examples of how our values and principles operate in
our business interactions with customers:

1. **All detected vulnerabilities are reported:** No detected
    vulnerabilities are stored for future personal or organizational
    use.

2. **Attacks are only carried out with authorization from the client
    and in personal test environments or environments created to be
    hacked (CTFs, challenge sites, etc.)**. Attacks are not carried out
    as a test, outside of work hours, or outside of the organization to
    third parties (partners, other companies, friends, etc.).

3. **The vulnerabilities found by the hacker are not revealed:**
    Detected vulnerabilities are only revealed to the client and
    authorized people working directly on the project. Hackers do not
    reveal any information regarding vulnerabilities, nor their
    existence, to any unauthorized person inside or outside of `Fluid
    Attacks`.

4. **Any infection installed for an attack is uninstalled:** After
    finishing a client’s project all the software installed to infect
    the system is completely removed. If this is not possible, the
    client is notified in writing regarding the details of this
    situation.

5. **All detected security issues are reported:** If we know a security
    issue exists, it is reported in writing to the client.

6. **Assume Responsibility:** If `Fluid Attacks` discovers any errors,
    or missteps, on our part during work on your project, we will inform
    you, take full responsibility for any impacts and repercussions, and
    do whatever is required to fix them.

## 4\. Ethics

In our company the process is every bit as important as the result. This
is why we adhere to the principles laid out in the
[Principles](#principles) section above and expect in-kind treatment for
everyone involved in your project.

Our business complies with all employer/employee regulations and laws,
such as fair labor practices, overtime compensation, equal employment
opportunity, etc. as set forth by Colombian law.

## 5\. Safekeeping of Information

We permanently monitor and manage the risks associated with our clients'
information.

## 6\. Problems and Complaints
