[eCPTX](https://elearnsecurity.com/product/ecptx-certification/)
is the most advanced pentesting certification
created by eLearnSecurity
and is now in its second version.
Individuals under evaluation must conduct a penetration test

They have to apply several sophisticated methodologies,

and give solid evidence of their findings
to obtain this certification.
