OSEE is the most complicated exploit development certification. It was
created by Offensive Security. The exam evaluates the content of the
Advanced Windows Exploitation course (EXP-401), as well as
professionals' lateral thinking and adaptability to challenges. They
have 72 hours to perform a thorough pentest on vulnerable software and
report it with sufficient detail, including the exploit methods
employed.
