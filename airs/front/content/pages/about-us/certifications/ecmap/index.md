[eCMAP](https://elearnsecurity.com/product/ecmap-certification/)
is a certification created by eLearnSecurity.
It is the most practical
and professionally-oriented certification in malware analysis.
In order to achieve it,
candidates have to analyze a malware sample,
demonstrate its functionality,
write a signature
that can be used to detect the malware in other systems or networks,
and provide a detailed professional report.
