OSWE is a certification designed to demonstrate the ability to exploit
web apps, which is recommended to be obtained after OSCP. In a 48-hour
exam within an isolated VPN, professionals assess and attack different
web apps and operating systems. They must prove their skills by
identifying vulnerabilities and then exploiting them.
