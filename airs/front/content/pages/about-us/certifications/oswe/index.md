[OSWE](https://www.offensive-security.com/awae-oswe/)
is a certification designed to demonstrate the ability to exploit web apps,
which is recommended to be obtained after OSCP.
In a 48-hour exam within an isolated VPN,
professionals assess and attack different web apps and operating systems.
They must prove their skills by identifying vulnerabilities
and then exploiting them.
