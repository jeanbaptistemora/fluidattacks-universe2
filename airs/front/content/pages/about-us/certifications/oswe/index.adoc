OSWE is a certification designed to demonstrate
the ability to exploit web apps,
which is recommended to be obtained after OSCP.
In a 48-hour exam within an isolated VPN,
professionals assess and attack different web apps and operating systems.
They must prove their skills
by identifying vulnerabilities and then exploiting them.
