[OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/)
is a professional certification in ethical hacking
developed by Offensive Security.
It is the first fully hands-on offensive information security certification
in the world.
It requires the professionals to prove
that they have a clear understanding of the penetration testing process
and lifecycle
through an arduous 24-hour exam.
