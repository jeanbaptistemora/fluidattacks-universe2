= Certified Red Team Professional (CRTP)

The Certified Red Team Professional (`CRTP`)
is a fully hands-on certification given
by the `Pentester Academy`. This certification guarantees that the person
has the expertise to assess the security of an `Active Directory` environment.
Professionals compromise `Active Directory`
by abusing features and functionalities
without relying on patchable exploits.
