= Web Applications

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
Like any other software, web applications can be susceptible to showing
vulnerabilities that put organizations’ and their clients’ information assets at
risk. Our ethical hackers target these vulnerabilities before cybercriminals
have the opportunity to exploit them. To ensure a fast remediation process, you
should not depend on defense by firewalls and should look for weaknesses in your
applications’ security features and other functions, and even in the open-source
software associated with them.

[role="fw3 f3 lh-2"]
Our web application security testing goes beyond the most popular cybersecurity
vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10) and is performed from different
perspectives, not only by automated tools but mainly by multiple members of our
red team, following techniques such as SAST, DAST and SCA. In addition, we
manually test and attack your web applications performing the Penetration
Testing technique, going deeper, finding the more complex vulnerabilities
(including those in the business logic of the app) and helping to avoid false
positives and false negatives. Fluid Attacks’ web application security testing
can also be included in your software development lifecycle (SDLC) if your
company is responsible for developing these applications.
