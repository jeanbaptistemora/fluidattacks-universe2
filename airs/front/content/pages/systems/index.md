## Web Applications

We can help you test your web applications' features, functions and
components which may possess security vulnerabilities that put your
company’s and users' information assets at risk. Our security testing
goes beyond the OWASP top ten web application security risks. <br>

</div>

<div class="sect1">

## Mobile Applications

We stay up to date with attack vectors on mobile applications and
provide you with security testing to identify vulnerabilities in this
type of system. We work with iOS, Android and Windows UI, and go beyond
the OWASP top 10 mobile vulnerabilities and other popular lists. <br>

## Thick Clients

We recognize the value of assessing not only thin client but also thick
client applications, which mainly operate on the client-side with or
without a connection to a network. Testing configurations and
interactions, we look for vulnerabilities that affect both the client
and the server-side. <br>

## APIs and Microservices

We are aware of the essential functions of APIs and microservices in the
applications and how both can be vulnerable to cyberattacks. We evaluate
microservices' interactions and operations, as well as the exposition of
APIs in order to detect vulnerabilities which could be exploited by
criminals. <br>

<div class="sect1">

## Cloud Infrastructure

We can help you test the cloud infrastructure your company has acquired
for its monetary and optimization benefits. We work on Azure, AWS, GCP
or any other cloud to identify configuration, application or network
weaknesses representing potential attack vectors. <br>

</div>

<div class="sect1">

## Networks and Hosts

We are able to perform assessments of hosts, devices and services of
your company’s internal and external networks. We can help you detect
misconfigurations and outdated components, among other flaws, going from
general structure analysis to specific element inspection. <br>

</div>

<div class="sect1">

## Internet of Things

We understand that IoT devices are often implemented in some companies'
infrastructures without the appropriate security measures. We provide
you with security testing for each connected element and every new
incorporation to find vulnerabilities that may affect other devices or
servers. <br>

</div>

## SCADA and OT

We also work on Operational Technology that serves for the monitoring of
industrial elements and processes. We implement security assessments in
the industrial control system SCADA, considering the cybersecurity risks
your company may face when OT networks are connected to the Internet. <br>
