## SAST

We offer you the SAST technique for rapid vulnerability detection at any
stage of your Software Development Lifecycle. SAST is a form of
white-box testing working on non-running software and is compatible with
a diversity of programming languages. <br />

## DAST

We provide you with the DAST technique for the identification of
vulnerabilities in running applications. DAST is a form of black-box
testing in which software weaknesses show a close connection to data,
configuration, and business logic, no matter the programming language. <br />

## MPT

We can perform Manual Penetration Testing (MPT) simulating real attacks
to exploit security vulnerabilities that are difficult to identify by
automatic methods. Through MPT, we can guarantee the reduction of rates
of false positives and negatives achieved by machines. <br />

## SCA

We have SCA among our techniques, a method for discovering cybersecurity
risks related to open-source and third-party components you use in your
software and systems. With SCA, we can inform you about licenses,
versions, and security weaknesses in all these components.

## RE

We possess certified hackers with the ability to deconstruct your
software through the complex technique of Reverse Engineering (RE). RE
mixes different methods and can give our hackers a broad understanding
of your systems and applications' security to identify
vulnerabilities. <br />

## PTaaS

We offer you the PTaaS model that goes beyond traditional Pentesting.
PTaaS joins our Continuous Hacking service and is supported by our
vulnerability management platform. We provide you with constant
comprehensive testing of your software, mixing manual and automatic
operations. <br />
