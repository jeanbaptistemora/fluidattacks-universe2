= Raas: That’s All We Needed!

We already know what link:../ransomware/[ransomware] is:
malicious software that, being on your computer,
is capable of encrypting some of your important files,
denying you access to them,
or blocking your operating system completely.
At the end of the day,
we know that paying the ransom to the criminal groups
does not guarantee that they will give you
the decryption key to unlock
link:https://cutt.ly/snkgWa8[your data].
Ransomware attacks are increasing year after year.
In 2020 the victim count in the USA was 2,474;
an increase of over 20% from 2019 and over 65% from 2018 (see Figure 1).
To understand why this is happening,
we must refer to the change in the attack model
and explain what *Ransomware as a Service (RaaS)* is.

== What is RaaS?

RaaS is a cyberattack model that replicates SaaS (Software as a Service).
In other words, it is a
link:https://cutt.ly/inkPsE7[subscription-based model]
in which a person asks for a “service”
which turns out to be
a previously designed ransomware tools "package" to attack.
The "novelty" of this cybercrime is that
anyone who has the money can become an attacker.
Before, the number of ransomware attackers was limited
to people who knew how
to enter a victim's cybernetic infrastructure
and encrypt its information.
Now, anyone who has the money
and intentions to commit such a crime could hire that service.

== How does it work?

First, cybercriminals write the ransomware code;
then, the person or company involved buys (or rents)
that code to execute their misdeeds.
If they prefer, they can subscribe monthly or at a
link:https://cutt.ly/nnkUXle[one-time fee].
The purchased package includes
link:https://cutt.ly/wnkUSJ8[a detailed step-by-step]
guide explaining how the program should be executed.
In some cases, criminal developers add
link:https://cutt.ly/ZnkhQh6[a real-time dashboard]
that shows what is going on with the victim.

To "sell" their service,
criminals must appeal to the credibility
they inspire in their potential customers.
Thus, link:https://cutt.ly/nnkUXle[*reputation*]
becomes a key element within this model of criminality.
Once the ransomware package is purchased,
the next thing to do is to get the victim to download the program.
For this purpose,
they use well-known techniques such as
link:../phishing/[phishing] or link:../smishing[smishing].
From here, the procedure continues as in any other
link:../ransomware[ransomware attack].
Another difference appears in the distribution
of the decryption data payment,
which is usually made in
link:https://cutt.ly/dnkUMwu[cryptocurrencies]
because they are untraceable.
Once the payment is made,
a link:https://cutt.ly/inkU2h8[money launderer]
distributes it both to the person who bought/rented
the ransomware package and to its developer.

Here we can see a
link:https://cutt.ly/wnkUSJ8[workflow diagram]
that shows how the operation works:

We must highlight, together with the
link:https://cutt.ly/wnkUSJ8[diagram’s authors],
that in practice affiliates do not choose only one developer.
In the same way,
they do not usually choose a single victim,
but target many at the same time.

== What's up with RaaS?

Five years ago, link:https://cutt.ly/bnkkbFF[Stampado] became popular
as a RaaS because
link:https://cutt.ly/lnkIont[their developers asked $39]
for their ransomware lifetime license package.
Something super cheap considering that in 2016
subscriptions were
link:https://cutt.ly/VnkIscy[“typically [sold\] for hundreds of dollars.”]
The person who hired the RaaS paid $39, but
link:https://cutt.ly/jnkIHGi[demanded averagely $722].
Outstandingly, in 2020 the average payment requested was
link:https://cutt.ly/wnkILUW[$111,605].
which represented an increase higher than 7,700%.
However, the ransom amount varies depending on
the type of ransomware that is at stake.
Currently, a "cheap" payment can be
link:https://cutt.ly/wnkILUW[$12K]
while an expensive one can be
link:https://cutt.ly/jnkICV5[$1,339,878]
(see Figure 3).
In total, ransomware attacks represented more than
link:https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2020_IC3Report.pdf[$29M]
in losses during 2020, only in the United States.
The amount is certainly much higher because, in ransomware,
data is not the only thing compromised, but also equipment,
time and money paid to third-party remediation services.
Besides, many companies do not report attacks received to the FBI.

One of the most recent and famous ransomware cases
in the USA was the link:../pipeline-ransomware-darkside/[Colonial Pipeline] one.
This american company paid the ransom asked by
the criminal gang DarkSide, which was nearly
link:https://cutt.ly/unkOqfK[$5M].
The University of California had another famous case: they
link:https://cutt.ly/BnkOrIB[paid more than a million dollars]
to the Netwalker ransomware gang.
Outside America, the Conti attack was also famous:
they asked Irish authorities
link:https://cutt.ly/xnkOorA[$20M]
to free their healthcare data system.
On occasions when victims refuse to pay,
criminals publish their data on the link:../dark-web/[Dark Web].
This happened to
link:https://cutt.ly/HnkOs3t[Lady Gaga]
and link:https://cutt.ly/gnkOjR7[Donald Trump] last year.
However, some requirements overpass the payment capacity of their victims.
Such was the case with REvil ransomware, which asked
link:https://cutt.ly/rnkOxzi[$42M]
to Allen Grubman, the entertainment superstars lawyer
(he had clients such as
link:https://cutt.ly/dnkOv2u[Bruce Springsteen, Elton John, Lady Gaga and U2]).
All the above means that by adopting the SaaS model,
criminals get more profitable.
The proof is in the pudding:
the GandCrab gang, one of the most famous RaaS,
announced that after a year
and a half of operations their clients' profits were
link:https://cutt.ly/dnkOQRK[$2B only in ransom payments].
From this, GrandCrab earned more than
link:https://cutt.ly/2nkOEWs[$150M].
As we already pointed out,
this model benefits criminal developers and non-developers.
Now anyone could perpetrate this type of cyberattack.
Finally, developers do not take risks as before,
because they are no longer directly exposed to the authorities.
Those who end up
link:https://cutt.ly/2nkOUga[perpetrating the main crime are third parties.]
