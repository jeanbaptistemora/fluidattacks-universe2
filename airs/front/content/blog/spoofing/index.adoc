= Spoofing, Pokémon & Vulnerability

is not the name of any Pokémon
(although it might be), but that of a type of scam.
Over the past year,
it accounted for more than $216M in losses in the United States
(according to the
link:https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2020_IC3Report.pdf[FBI report]).
Through an email, phone call, or text message,
criminals pretend to be a reliable source
to deceive their victims (see Figure 1).

*Spoofing* has almost a ninth of the victims that
link:../smishing/[phishing/vishing/smishing/pharming] have (see Figure 2).
In this regard, spoofing is very dangerous
because of the amount of money stolen
in a single transaction
and not due to the number of victims fallen in this ruse.
In January of this year,
link:https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/pr/us-attorney-s-office-warns-scammers-are-spoofing-office-phone-number-try-obtain-money[Washington State reported]
$777,045 in losses
related to this scam.
A few days ago in New York City,
the finance department of a clinical trial software firm
link:https://www.forbes.com/sites/tmobile/2021/04/26/what-your-business-should-know-about-email-spoofing/?sh=68afa5e844ed[transferred to a criminal account $4.8M]
due to a spoofed email.

A criminal link:https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spoofing.asp[could imitate an email]
with the sender's name from a forged IP address.
Thanks to it, criminals can send a link
to re-addresses a page with a counterfeit *Domain Name System (DNS)*.
link:https://www.winknews.com/2021/04/29/scammers-are-stealing-info-of-floridians-whove-claimed-unemployment/[Criminals use to do]
a two-verification trick
and favor that email
using phone calls or SMSs
addressed to the company's financial teams.
Financial institutions, banks, commercial companies, and government entities
are the main targets of this type of deception.

== How does link:https://terranovasecurity.com/what-is-spoofing/[spoofing] work?

=== ARP-MAC-IP combo

This combo is the perfect trick to
divert resources, money, information, and data.
To do this, criminals supplant a set of internet protocols,
that is to say, both the transmitter
and the receiver of data between the connected computers.
Think, for example, that you want to send a gift to a friend who lives far away.
For that, you decide that the best way is to trust a Courier.
In this case, both your address
and your friend's address would be two *Internet Protocol (IP)* addresses.
The
link:https://docs.fluidattacks.com/criteria/vulnerabilities/077[*Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)*]
would be the path that the Courier has to travel
to send the package.
And the *Media Access Control (MAC)*
address would be each one's ID number.
In this example, the spoofing combo would be like this:
a cybercriminal fakes the ARP (the path) of a local area network
that routes traffic on the web in a different direction.
Then, by falsifying the MAC (your friend ID) address
and falsifying the IPs (your friend's address),
criminals could disguise a device
as if it were enrolled in the target network.
By doing so, traditional restriction mechanisms are not asked to access.
From there, all the information could be redirected to the criminal's computer.
Still, the boldest criminals do not keep all that information
but distort it and send it to the genuine recipient.

=== DNS-Website combo

Criminals who know the
link:https://docs.fluidattacks.com/criteria/vulnerabilities/084/[DNS]
can assign domains to previously forged IPs.
When people access a web page using standard URLs (Uniform Resource Locators),
criminals can store caches of those DNS for their convenient sides.
Once that process is performed,
the victim enters, without notice,
into a malicious replica of the desired domain.
Furthermore, that replica is usually updated
according to the original website changes,
making it challenging to identify the farce.

=== Email-Phone-SMS combo

This combo may be the one that requires minor work from the criminals' side.
First, they imitate a mail header
by changing the mail sender
to look like a legitimate source from the victims' perspective.
Then they send an email with the appearance of being official.
In it, they require victims to make a payment or transaction to an account.
Next, a caller identification is forged
to impersonate the person or company
from which the mail was allegedly sent to rectify the email info.
If that is not enough,
criminals can use a forgery SMS (short message service)
to double-check what was said by mail.
At the same time,
they send a false notification to confirm that
the alleged recipient of the transaction received
the money or that the supposedly due invoice was paid.

=== GPS

If a criminal could alter geolocation services,
he could use them to disrupt transportation apps
used by individuals or companies to guide their trips.
The problem, of course, would be more linked to sabotage than anything else.
Criminals could, for example, cause a person to reach an unexpected place
by resetting the app GPS or send them on routes
that have traffic or road obstacles.
Anyway, this type of spoofing is much more dangerous
when used as an extra ingredient in one of the above combos.

=== How can we deal with such scams?

Of course, the best way not to fall into such scams
is to be alert to emails, calls, and SMS.
However, prevention will always have better results than corrective actions.
In this case, prevention could include shielding emails
from suspicious accounts. For example,
link:https://www.forbes.com/sites/tmobile/2021/04/26/what-your-business-should-know-about-email-spoofing/?sh=68afa5e844ed[companies can add]
"Domain Key Identified Mail (DKIM),
Domain-based Message Authentication,
Reporting and Conformance (DMARC),
and Sender Policy Framework (SPF)
records to their business's domain name record."
If your company makes these small changes, it will not regret it,
as it will send all suspicious emails to the junk folder.
Once a scam is discovered, it must be reported.
Those who live in the United States
and have been scammed
while working in a company can file their complaints on the
link:https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us[Federal Communications Commission]
official website. They can also go to the
link:https://www.ic3.gov/Home/ComplaintChoice[Crime Complaint Center]
website or find out more info
link:https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/on-the-internet[FBI's page]
for this purpose.

Now, I bet that you've heard about *Pikachu*, *Ash Ketchum*, or *Pokémon*.
However, I also bet that you don't know what links one of the
link:https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-03-02-gotta-cash-em-all-how-pok-mon-became-the-worlds-biggest-games-franchise#:~:text=Quantifying%20Pok%C3%A9mon's%20success%20is%20tricky,website%20a%20few%20years%20back[most valued franchises in the world]
with spoofing. So, to understand it,
we have to talk a bit about Pokémon.

One of the latest hits of this franchise was their collaborative success
with the enterprise Niantic when they decided to launch Pokémon Go.
The goal of this game is to catch Pokémon in real places.
So, players must go outside their houses to catch them all.
But recently, with COVID-19 confinements,
people have resorted to other ways of walking around the globe:
link:https://www.republicworld.com/technology-news/gaming/how-to-play-pokemon-go-without-moving-learn-about-it-in-this-guide.html[altering their GPS systems].
In other words, players trick the app
into believing that they have somewhere else
to make Pokémon appear so that they can catch them.
Seemingly, many people are interested in such uses.
So, they've googled how the Pokémon Go app can be spoofed to catch Pokémon.
Therefore, those two words (spoofing and Pokémon)
have been linked since 2020
in search-trading websites (see Figure 3).
That's why we say that each other's fun is the danger of others.
In seeking to innocently catch more Pokémon,
spoofing has become more popular.
In turn, this makes more people use this type of cyberattack technique,
making companies more vulnerable to being attacked.
