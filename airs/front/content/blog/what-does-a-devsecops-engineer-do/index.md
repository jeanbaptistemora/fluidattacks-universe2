[DevSecOps](../what-is-devsecops/) is a methodology
that results from expanding responsibility for security
to organizational functions,
especially development and operations.
As a model in cybersecurity,
it contemplates people,
policies,
processes
and technologies.
In this blog post,
we will talk
about the individuals that lead the enactment of this methodology:
DevSecOps engineers.

## What is a DevSecOps engineer?

DevSecOps engineers are the professionals
[responsible for](https://www.devopsdigest.com/how-to-become-a-devsecops-engineer)
bringing development,
security
and operations together
to enhance the security stance of the organization.
They [monitor](https://www.devopsschool.com/blog/devsecops-engineers-roles-and-responsibilities/)
and automate security processes and test systems.
This results in the protection of data
and information technology (IT) infrastructure.
[Much like](https://devops.com/how-to-become-a-devsecops-engineer/)
individuals in other IT security roles,
DevSecOps engineers are familiar with cybersecurity software
and best practices
such as conducting risk assessments and threat modeling.

## What are the skills of a DevSecOps engineer?

It should come as no surprise
that DevSecOps engineers often prove
to have a great deal of [**proficiency**](https://www.devopsdigest.com/how-to-become-a-devsecops-engineer)
**in programming**.
They have to be able to sit down with DevOps engineers (program developers)
to work out the solution
to a vulnerability reported in the organization's system.
[Some of the languages](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/What-it-takes-to-be-a-DevSecOps-engineer)
DevSecOps engineers know
are Java,
JavaScript,
Perl,
PHP,
Python
and Ruby.

They often have **experience with CI/CD tools**.
These include Chef,
CircleCI,
GitLab CI/CD,
Jenkins,
Puppet
and Spinnaker.
Other developer tools they often know their way around
[are](https://devops.com/how-to-become-a-devsecops-engineer/)
Kubernetes,
Docker
and Amazon Web Services (AWS).

As we said [in a blog post](../what-is-devsecops/),
automated security checks are a part of the DevSecOps methodology.
Then,
DevSecOps engineers often [have](https://devops.com/how-to-become-a-devsecops-engineer/)
**a good understanding of automated application security testing tools**.
For example [SAST](../../categories/sast/)
and [DAST](../../categories/dast/) tools.
These professionals must know
how to [choose and deploy](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/What-it-takes-to-be-a-DevSecOps-engineer)
these tools appropriately.

Another useful skill for a DevSecOps engineer is
**knowing how to conduct risk assessments**.
They must have rigorous processes to test the security
of the organization's system
and analyze its risk exposure.
To do this effectively,
they must be [up to date](https://devops.com/how-to-become-a-devsecops-engineer/)
with DevOps culture and principles,
cybersecurity threats,
software
and best practices.

Lastly,
**teamwork and communication skills**
are no doubt something that they can't do without.
Indeed,
in order to integrate security into DevOps,
they have to work with others efficiently.
Also,
they must be able to communicate their knowledge of threats clearly
to both their peers and employers.
This means they often need to express ideas in a more simple way
and still manage to get the point across.

## DevSecOps engineer's responsibilities in organizations

The skills listed above can give you a pretty good idea
of what DevSecOps engineers are asked to do.
They use their experience
to assess the security of their organization's systems.
They make sure to do this all the time.
When they find a vulnerability during development,
they work along with others to fix it asap.
In this regard,
they need to be able to present these security issues
and the solutions they came up with to a varied audience.
But they are also expected to anticipate threats
and [add countermeasures](https://www.devopsdigest.com/how-to-become-a-devsecops-engineer)
to prevent them.
As a result,
they keep the organization's digital assets safe.

[It has been said that](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/What-it-takes-to-be-a-DevSecOps-engineer),
DevSecOps engineers often have to work
"with colleagues who are skeptical or uninformed about \[their\] role."
This may be because they are challenged
by the organization's transition [from DevOps to DevSecOps](../what-is-devsecops/).
Teams may feel put out
with the idea of security maybe being an obstacle
to fast integration and deployment.
DevSecOps engineers are then needed to educate
how best practices like code review improve the overall results
and help comply with security standards.

## DevSecOps roles and DevSecOps engineers

Within organizations,
it is possible to have different DevSecOps roles.
As a piece of opinion ([read it here](https://www.slideshare.net/MichaelMan11/extract-oct-2019-dsolg-rolling-slides))
says,
there seem to be three types.
One is designed for people
with experience automating infrastructure deployments (e.g., cloud engineers).
Another role for people with experience
"designing and implementing security testing tools
and integrating those into pipelines."
And yet another
for people who work along with the development team
to review,
triage
and close vulnerabilities (e.g., [security champions](../secdevops-security-champions/)).
From what we've said so far,
it can be argued
that a DevSecOps engineer's role covers all three.

## How to become a DevSecOps engineer

Whether you wish to become one
or just want to know
what credentials you should look for in someone's resumé,
some sites report the degrees that DevSecOps engineers often hold.
These include [tech-related fields](https://www.devopsdigest.com/how-to-become-a-devsecops-engineer)
like computer science or computer engineering.
However,
a degree in math is also mentioned as an option.

Some skills listed above can be self-taught.
That is the case for proficiency in programming languages or development tools.
Others can be nurtured [in formal employment](https://devops.com/how-to-become-a-devsecops-engineer/)
or through an internship.
In fact,
it has been advised
that prospective DevSecOps engineers work first in a non-DevOps IT position
before getting into DevSecOps.
It's also advised to enroll in courses
that teach DevOps principles and how to build applications securely.
For example,
prospective DevSecOps engineers would profit a lot
from [taking secure coding courses](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/What-it-takes-to-be-a-DevSecOps-engineer).

Yet another step is to become certified.
We'll get to a list of certifications in a moment.
A prospective DevSecOps engineer should think of training first.
These are some of the [advised security certification courses](https://www.devopsschool.com/blog/devsecops-engineers-roles-and-responsibilities/):
DevSecOps Certified Professional ([DSOCP](https://certification-courses.github.io/devops-certifications/certifications/devsecops-certified-professional.html)),
Certified Cyber Security Expert ([CCSE](https://www.checkpoint.com/downloads/training/CCSE_Overview_Flyer.pdf)),
Certified Information Security Manager ([CISM](https://www.isaca.org/credentialing/cism)),
Certified Information Systems Auditor ([CISA](https://www.isaca.org/credentialing/cisa))
and Cisco Certified Network Associate ([CCNA](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna.html)).

## What are a DevSecOps engineer's certifications?

Certifications help stand out from other candidates
when you apply for a job.
But they also can be pursued out of love for the challenge.
Indeed,
they put a candidate's patience
and stamina to the test.

It is [advisable](https://devops.com/how-to-become-a-devsecops-engineer/)
to get certified by the [DevOps Institute](https://www.devopsinstitute.com/certifications/)
with certifications like DevOps Foundation,
DevSecOps Engineering (DSOE)
[and](https://www.devopsdigest.com/how-to-become-a-devsecops-engineer)
DevOps Leader.
The [Certified DevSecOps Professional](https://www.practical-devsecops.com/certified-devsecops-professional/)
certification
from Practical DevSecOps is also [recommended](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/What-it-takes-to-be-a-DevSecOps-engineer).
It has also been advised to get practical certifications
issued by Cisco,
CompTIA and Microsoft,
as well as the Certified Ethical Hacker ([CEH](https://www.eccouncil.org/programs/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh/))
certification.
Other [related certifications](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/What-it-takes-to-be-a-DevSecOps-engineer)
are [Certified Secure Software Lifecycle Professional](https://academy.isecauditors.com/certificacion-csslp),
GIAC (Global Information Assurance Certification)
[Mobile Device Security Analyst](https://www.giac.org/certifications/mobile-device-security-analyst-gmob/)
and [ISO 27001](https://www.certifiedinfosec.com/iso-27001-lead-auditor/introduction).

## Do you want to know more about DevSecOps?

At `Fluid Attacks`,
we help enterprises integrate security into DevOps
from the very beginning of the software development lifecycle.
Our [DevSecOps solution](../../solutions/devsecops/) is fueled
by our most trusted method: [ethical hacking](../../solutions/ethical-hacking/).
This method
comprises the manual use of different tools
(e.g., SAST, DAST, [SCA](../../categories/sca/)).
It allows us to detect the most intricate and severe vulnerabilities.
Additionally,
our solution offers an automated DevSecOps agent,
which functionality is to break the build.
This is a security measure
that can be set up in a CI/CD environment
to prevent any software author
from deploying a system with open vulnerabilities to production.
As a result,
enterprises can achieve high remediation rates
and enhance the security of every commit.
