= A Breach of Epic Proportions

"Who is Epik?"
Many website owners have been wondering
since they got a notification last week
from the data breach tracking service link:https://haveibeenpwned.com/[HaveIBeenPwned] (HIBP).
What happened was that Epik's massive database
containing very detailed information linked to millions of accounts
had been leaked.
Strikingly,
not everyone affected had any relation with Epik.

Let's look at the details.

== Operation EPIK FAIL successful

First off,
link:https://www.epik.com/[Epik] is an organization
that provides link:https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Domain+registrar[domain name registration] and link:https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/web-hosting[web hosting].
This means that they are one of the places
other companies go to
in order to register a unique domain name on the Internet
and that they may keep
and manage these companies' websites on a server.
On September 13th,
independent journalist Steven Monacelli tweeted
a link:https://twitter.com/stevanzetti/status/1437482759241469958[press release] by Anonymous
that was posted on a website
dedicated to what they called "link:https://archive.is/Czuu2[Operation EPIK FAIL]."
Anonymous claimed that they were able
to obtain a "decade's worth of data from the company."

On September 14th,
when interrogated by link:https://therecord.media/anonymous-hacks-and-leaks-data-from-domain-registrar-epik/[The Record],
among others,
Epik's spokesperson said
that they were "not aware of any breach."
The following day,
however,
the company finally link:https://twitter.com/EpikDotCom/status/1439020408783654917[tweeted],
confirming that it had been hacked.
That day,
users got a link:https://www.dailydot.com/debug/epik-hack-far-right-sites-anonymous/[vague email] from the CEO
acknowledging a "security incident."

.link:https://twitter.com/EpikDotCom/status/1439020408783654917[Tweet] by Epik acknowledging the hack.

Now,
why did Anonymous target Epik?
The evidence shows
that the hacktivist group had been motivated
due to the fact that Epik has been hosting websites
where link:https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2019/01/11/problem-epik-proportions[hate-fueled] content thrives,
some of which link:https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/09/texas-abortion-snitch-website-kicked-off-godaddy-for-invading-peoples-privacy/?itm_source=parsely-api[had been deplatformed] by other mainstream hosts.
As evidenced by investigative reporter Michael Edison Hayden,
Epik's reputation has to do,
in part,
with its founder
and CEO Robert Monster
rubbing elbows with controversial figures.
Some of Epik's link:https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/09/epik-data-breach-impacts-15-million-users-including-non-customers/[controversial clients] have included
the Republican Party of Texas,
Parler, Gab and 8chan.

According to the description of the hack,
Anonymous leaked link:https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Epik[180 gigabytes] of data,
including account credentials,
domain purchases and payment history.
In the link:https://twitter.com/svpndotcom/status/1439456727133474818[notice] sent to its users,
Epik told them to look out for "unusual activity"
involving their "credit card numbers,
registered names, user names, emails, and passwords."
The admin of a link:https://twitter.com/epikfailsnippet[Twitter account] dedicated to the hack
link:https://twitter.com/epikfailsnippet/status/1440579325447659526[asserted] that the leaked database is global,
containing information of users from various countries,
not only from the US.
This tweet also informed
that the website owners' physical addresses
and phone numbers
were among the leaked data.
How much more specific could it be?

A compressed version of the torrent
used to download Epik's database
was made link:https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Epik[readily available] to everyone.
The Daily Dot downloaded the data
and link:https://www.dailydot.com/debug/epik-hack-far-right-sites-anonymous/[contacted] several individuals
listed as running various controversial websites.
They confirmed
that the information listed in the breach was accurate.
The Daily Dot also talked to an engineer
who conducted an impact assessment for one of Epik's users.
He said
that "with all the data in the leak
[...] any attacker
could easily take over the websites of countless Epik customers."

== WHOIS compromised?

The official information about the breach
link:https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites[posted in HIBP]
indicates that more than 15M accounts were compromised.
We mentioned
that many people who are not Epik's clients were pwned too.
Even HIBP founder,
Troy Hunt,
link:https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1439705567400894464[tweeted] that he is among the people
whose information was leaked.
He researched the situation
and concluded that Epik had been link:https://www.targetinternet.com/what-is-data-scraping-and-how-can-you-use-it/[data-scraping],
that is,
extracting and harvesting information
from people and organizations who own website domains,
even those who are not its customers.
Troy link:https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1439007532287082496[informed]
that Epik scraped this information
from the global database of domain holders
called link:https://who.is/[WHOIS directory].
This is a public directory,
meaning the information held there is searchable
and available for all to see,
in case there's any need to contact a domain owner.

.link:https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1439705567400894464[Tweet] by Troy Hunt, founder of HaveIBeenPwned.

But if WHOIS records can be seen
and scraped by anyone,
then
why are people who were not Epik's customers so preoccupied?
link:https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/09/epik-data-breach-impacts-15-million-users-including-non-customers/[Reportedly],
these people are concerned
that they could be falsely linked
with Epik's controversial background.
We would also argue
that malicious hackers may use the leaked information
to try to scam website owners
through link:../social-engineering/[social engineering tactics].

Another issue is
why they were scraping all these data
in the first place.
The possibility link:https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/cyber-security-today-sept-22-2021-epik-breach-has-epic-ramifications-misconfigurations-by-eventbuilder-users-and-phishing-attacks-on-the-aviation-sector/458810[has been suggested]
that Epik saw the database as a source of potential customers
and wanted to pitch them for business.
Epik also appeared
to be holding on to this database for a long time.
Ars Technica link:https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/09/epik-data-breach-impacts-15-million-users-including-non-customers/[took a look] at the data
and they "noticed WHOIS records for some domains
were dated
and contained incorrect information
about domain owners—people who no longer own these assets."
It's not the first time
that breaches show
that some organizations
hold on to the personal information
of unsuspecting individuals.
There was the case of Apollo,
a data aggregator
and analytics service.
As link:https://www.wired.com/story/apollo-breach-linkedin-salesforce-data/[reported by WIRED],
security researcher Vinny Troia
discovered
that Apollo contained more than 200M contact listings
at the time of its data leak
in summer 2018.
Furthermore,
Hunt said about this breach
that more than 100M people had their data leaked
and they didn't even know about Apollo's existence.

== Could it have been prevented?

According to link:https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/epik-website-bug-hacked/[TechCrunch],
security researcher Corben Leo
had warned Epik
about a security vulnerability
as early as January.
Monster acknowledged
that he received the warning message,
but he didn't tell
whether or not he acted on it.
Apparently,
Anonymous could have actually hacked Epik months ago,
in February,
as suggested by the date
of the most recent files
in the leaked database.
