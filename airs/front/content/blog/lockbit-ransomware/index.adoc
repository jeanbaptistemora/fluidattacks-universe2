= Now a Ransomware Seducing Insiders?

link:../ransomware/[Ransomware],
link:../pipeline-ransomware-darkside/[ransomware],
link:../cyber-insurance-ransomware/[ransomware];
everyone is talking about it.
Being a victim of ransomware scares the crap out of many of us.
Nevertheless,
despite all the dissemination about it,
many people may not be,
or irrationally may not _want_ to be,
sufficiently aware of it.
That's why we continue to publish information
related to this type of attack.
Also,
because it is a phenomenon that continues to evolve,
and new groups of criminals
with different forms of malware and strategies
keep sprouting up and shooting at new targets.
Today it's time for LockBit,
the ransomware behind which there is a gang
that would like to hire some of your employees.
Let's see what it's all about.

== What is LockBit, and what does it do?

link:https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/lockbit-malware-what-it-is-how-it-works-and-how-to-prevent-it-malware-spotlight/[Two years ago],
the data encryption malware LockBit began operating,
which later became part of the Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) model
—something we have already referred to
link:../ransomware-as-a-service/[in a previous post].
Among Lockbit's outstanding attributes are its abilities to self-propagate
and encrypt large and valuable enterprise IT systems
in a short time to avoid detection.
link:https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lockbit-ransomware-moves-quietly-on-the-network-strikes-fast/[As Ilascu for Bleeping Computer once said],
"LockBit attacks leave few traces for forensic analysis
as the malware loads into the system memory,
with logs and supporting files removed upon execution."

LockBit is launched by attackers through a PowerShell script,
usually after compromising a network,
for example,
by link:../pass-cracking/[brute force] or link:../phishing/[phishing]
(or because of one of your employees' will).
This malicious software
disables the security and information recovery programs
as a preliminary step in an independent way.
Once the network is vulnerable,
LockBit automatically spreads easily across different devices.
From there,
in its operation as ransomware,
it starts encrypting system files.
And,
link:https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/lockbit-ransomware[as shared in Kaspersky],
"Victims can only unlock their systems
via a custom key created by LockBit's proprietary decryption tool."
LockBit changes the names of the file extensions
on the target device
to ".abcd"
and in each affected folder creates a text file,
with instructions for the victim,
called "Restore-My-Files.txt"
(see Figure 1).

image::https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1630080709/blog/lockbit-ransomware/lockbit_howtoremove_vprjhu.webp[Restore-My-Files.txt]

link:https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/lockbit-malware-what-it-is-how-it-works-and-how-to-prevent-it-malware-spotlight/[The victim then] has at her disposal a link:https://www.torproject.org/[Tor] link
through which she can learn more about the ransomware,
even establishing direct communication with one of the LockBit operators.
These conversations begin to revolve around "the ransom demand,
payment deadline, method —usually in Bitcoin—
and instructions on how to purchase cryptocurrency,"
link:https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-deep-dive-into-the-operations-of-the-lockbit-ransomware-group/[said Osborne for Zero Day].
The victim also receives the opportunity
to decrypt and recover a small file
as a supposed warranty that the other files can be retrieved
once the payment is made.
We must also note that,
apart from this ".abcd" variant,
link:https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/lockbit-ransomware[we can also find] the ".LockBit" extension variant
and even a version in which the Tor browser
(link:../dark-web/[generally used for the Dark Web])
is no longer required.

On the other hand,
among the improvements of this malware reported later,
we can recognize its ability to disable the security prompts
that users receive when an application tries to run as administrator.
LockBit now has a configuration
that allows it to steal copies of data from servers.
That's data that can be made public at the whim of the attackers,
especially if the victims are reluctant to respond
with the requested payment.
LockBit,
in its 2.0 version,
has "one of the fastest and most efficient encryption methods
in today's ransomware threat landscape,"
link:https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/h/lockbit-resurfaces-with-version-2-0-ransomware-detections-in-chi.html[according to Trend Micro].
link:https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lockbit-ransomware-recruiting-insiders-to-breach-corporate-networks/[Another significant change]
(in terms of presentation),
for many people outlandish,
has been the offer of millions of dollars
in exchange for "*corporate insiders*"
who help breach and encrypt the targeted companies' networks
(see Figure 2).

== An eye-catching recent case

link:https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-deep-dive-into-the-operations-of-the-lockbit-ransomware-group/[It is now common] for ransomware payouts to reach millions of dollars;
remember link:../jbs-revil-cyberattack/[the case of JBS].
However,
link:https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-deep-dive-into-the-operations-of-the-lockbit-ransomware-group/[according to Osborne],
LockBit affiliates are currently requesting an average
of around 85 thousand dollars from each victim,
of which 10-30% corresponds to RaaS operators.
One of the most reported cases of attack with this malware
in recent days
has been the hit
on the Fortune 500
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accenture[professional services and consulting multinational]
link:https://www.accenture.com/us-en[*Accenture*].
link:https://www.zdnet.com/article/accenture-says-lockbit-ransomware-attack-caused-no-impact-on-operations-or-clients/[They were listed] on the leak site of the LockBit group
next to a countdown timer,
and the operators left a short message
from a supposed insider (see Figure 3).

.LockBit page screenshot (source: link:https://www.zdnet.com/a/hub/i/2021/08/11/86850a36-4a44-4a8b-bf62-768796ddcb50/e8fcnngucaqitfy.png[zdnet.com]).
image::https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1630080708/blog/lockbit-ransomware/lockbit_zdnet_a6sdhw.webp[LockBit page]

Once the timer reached zero,
some of Accenture's information would be released,
and indeed it was.
However,
there was link:https://therecord.media/accenture-downplays-ransomware-attack-as-lockbit-gang-leaks-corporate-data/[no sensitive information there]
—mainly marketing material.
The company had already said
that the ransomware had not affected its operations
and that they had managed to restore systems from their backups.
link:https://twitter.com/AuCyble/status/1425422006690881541[From the research firm Cyble],
there was commentary
that the LockBit group was demanding $50M as a ransom
for a database of approximately 6TB.
Do they really have all that data,
and will it be revealed in time?
Or is it just bullshit?
Has Accenture already made a payment?
One thing that seems clear for now is that
the attack's aftermath will be a bad reputation for this organization,
at least as far as link:https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/security-index[its cybersecurity services] are concerned.

== For the umpteenth time, let's question ourselves

Today,
it is quite curious that most of the companies
that were victims of ransomware attacks
and paid the ransom
(link:https://www.zdnet.com/article/most-firms-face-second-ransomware-attack-after-paying-off-first/[said to be around 80% within one study])
have been victims a second time,
perhaps even at the hands of the same criminals.
How not to come to one's senses after such a blow?
Professional services and sectors such as transportation,
construction, and food
are among the most threatened by LockBit around the world.
Within these sectors and,
in fact,
within all companies,
cybersecurity should gain priority,
primarily in terms of prevention.
But we are witnessing the paltry value that messages
like "don't wait to be attacked to take action"
are having.
Now,
in many cases,
there's no action even after impact!

Regardless of the veracity of what a man referred to as "Aleks,"
an alleged LockBit operator,
link:https://talos-intelligence-site.s3.amazonaws.com/production/document_files/files/000/095/481/original/010421_LockBit_Interview.pdf[told Cisco Talos a year ago],
some of the words he conveyed could work
as an additional nudge for many of us.
Not a boost to criminality,
of course not,
but to adequate security practices.
What Aleks said was that he became interested in ransomware
because of its profitability
but that it also allowed him to "_teach_" organizations
about the consequences of inappropriate data protection.
Therefore,
it is worth asking,
how sure are you
that your software and systems
are in optimal security conditions?

Additionally,
the intentions of LockBit 2.0 are already forcing even many
to ask questions perhaps not previously considered.
We now enter the area of *reliability* of your staff.
To conclude,
a perfect example of such questions
is the one link:https://securityboulevard.com/2021/08/lockbit-ransomware-wants-to-hire-your-employees/[posed by Div of Cybereason]:
