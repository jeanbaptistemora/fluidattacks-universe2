= Come To Your Senses Already!

When it comes to cybersecurity,
the expression _you snooze, you lose_
perhaps never ceases to apply.
There are so many security vulnerabilities appearing every day.
In 2020,
for example,
there was apparently link:https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/94602-record-number-of-critical-and-high-severity-vulnerabilities-were-logged-to-the-nist-nvd-in-2020[an average of 50 per day].
However,
patches continually emerge to close them.
The problem arrives when people fail to consider them,
thus increasing their risk of getting screwed.
It is not uncommon to see a person or firm
who inadvertently falls asleep
and ends up losing in this field.
But,
the most peculiar of all
is that now that loss can also be provoked by a nightmare.

== What kind of nightmare are we referring to?

About two months ago,
Microsoft warned about and released an out-of-band patch
(i.e., link:https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/out-of-band-patch[a fix published] at a time other than the regular release time)
for *PrintNightmare*, a security flaw.
This bug that initially seemed to involve _two_ vulnerabilities,
link:https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34527[CVE-2021-34527] and link:https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-1675[CVE-2021-1675],
allows attackers to take control of PCs.
The issue lies specifically in the Windows link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/printdocs/print-spooler[Print Spooler] (spoolsv.exe),
a printing management service
link:https://www.semperis.com/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-printnightmare-the-critical-windows-print-spooler-vulnerability/["enabled by default] in all Windows clients and servers."
As long as that first patch
and the subsequent ones
are link:https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/[not applied to the client systems] that keep the service active,
attackers will have code to exploit.

In general,
we can understand PrintNightmare
as a link:https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/remote-code-execution-rce/[remote code execution] (RCE) vulnerability
based on operations improperly performed with privileged files
by the mentioned Windows service.
Therefore,
attackers exploiting such a flaw
link:https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/remote-code-execution-rce/[can execute malicious code] with system privileges
inside the target device without physical access.
Moreover,
they can install software,
steal, modify or remove information,
or "create new accounts with full user rights,"
link:https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34527[according to Microsoft].

link:https://therecord.media/poc-released-for-dangerous-windows-printnightmare-bug/[As Cimpanu commented] for The Record in late June,
a part of PrintNightmare
(at least that one with ID 1675)
was at that time the latest of many Print Spooler-related findings.
It turns out that this bug had been discovered earlier this year
by several researchers.
Microsoft already had the patch for all its users
to update their systems.
However,
the snag arose when supposedly by an "accident,"
technical details of the bug and a link:https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/poc-proof-of-concept/[proof-of-concept] exploit
ended up being shared on GitHub by analysts
from a Chinese security firm.
This information was online for just a few hours,
but it was enough to be cloned by different users.
From there,
it reappeared later in the public domain.

Since then,
it was known that this vulnerability could affect all versions
of the Windows operating system,
even those now rarely used,
such as Vista and XP.
The nightmare started to look darker
when several researchers reported
that the patch delivered by Microsoft was insufficient.
Apparently,
it _only_ repaired that "part" 1675
(link:https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/privilege-escalation/[privilege escalation] vulnerability)
but not "part" 34527
(RCE vulnerability),
both of which were initially grouped
as if they were a single security flaw.
Hence,
Microsoft requested users to disable the service,
link:https://therecord.media/poc-released-for-dangerous-windows-printnightmare-bug/["especially on Windows servers] running as domain controllers
from where attackers can pivot to entire internal networks."
Days later,
in early July,
the second patch was released,
link:https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/[surprisingly even for Windows 7],
which had lost general support more than a year ago.
Microsoft recommended its installation asap.

After Microsoft deployed patches for other versions of Windows
(link:https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5005010-restricting-installation-of-new-printer-drivers-after-applying-the-july-6-2021-updates-31b91c02-05bc-4ada-a7ea-183b129578a7[printer driver installation restrictions] were becoming manifest),
link:https://www.zdnet.com/article/get-updating-microsoft-delivers-printnightmare-patch-for-more-windows-versions/[there were complaints] that they did not provide sufficient protection.
Ideas from researchers began to be made public
about how the patches Microsoft had already submitted to close PrintNightmare
could be bypassed.
It was not until the first half of this month
that authors like link:https://www.secureworld.io/industry-news/author/drew-todd[Todd from SecureWorld]
were able to say something like the following:
link:https://www.secureworld.io/industry-news/microsoft-printnightmare-vulnerability["Now, Microsoft] has finally fixed the vulnerability."

At first,
it was curious to see
that the security flaw Todd referred to in his post as PrintNightmare
had been link:https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-36958[CVE-2021-36958],
a different ID than those we saw above.
However,
link:https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/08/10/point-and-print-default-behavior-change/[Microsoft recently reported] that there are really several vulnerabilities
that together receive that name.
(Today, it seems, link:https://therecord.media/printnightmare-vulnerability-weaponized-by-magniber-ransomware-gang/[they are about 10].)
Another,
for example,
is the link:https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34481[CVE-2021-34481].
It was in relation to this design flaw
that link:https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/08/10/point-and-print-default-behavior-change/[Microsoft exposed its new solution approach] on August 10.
It is about changing the default behavior
of the Windows link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/print/introduction-to-point-and-print[Point and Print] feature.
In a nutshell,
link:https://therecord.media/microsoft-to-require-admin-rights-before-using-windows-point-and-print-feature/[as Cimpanu said],
"While until now,
any user could add a new printer to a Windows computer,
[from now on],
only admin users will be able to add or update a printer with drivers
from a remote print server."

== Now ransomware weaponized with the nightmare?

Despite all the effort,
the nightmare cannot come to an end
as long as many remain asleep.
Meanwhile,
others take advantage of it.
More than a month ago,
link:https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/printnightmare-vulnerability/40520/[Kaspersky pointed out] that cybercriminals could use PrintNightmare
to carry out link:../ransomware/[ransomware attacks].
Well,
that's indeed what has happened.
Since mid-July,
the group of malicious hackers behind the link:https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2017/10/magniber-ransomware-exclusively-for-south-koreans/[Magniber ransomware]
is link:https://therecord.media/printnightmare-vulnerability-weaponized-by-magniber-ransomware-gang/[leveraging this bug]
(especially 34527)
to breach Windows systems,
link:https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/magniber-ransomware-caught-using-printnightmare-vulnerability/[mainly in South Korea].

link:https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-now-attackers-are-exploiting-windows-printnightmare-vulnerabilities/[According to Palmer in ZDNet],
another group that has begun to attack
taking quick advantage of PrintNightmare
is Vice Society,
which appeared recently in June.
They use "double extortion attacks,
stealing data from victims
and threatening to publish it if the ransom isn't paid."
Apparently,
their victims include small and medium-sized organizations,
mainly educational institutions.

Certainly,
these are not the only threat actors
resorting to the nightmare for their benefit.
And,
no doubt,
the number of ransomware groups
seeking to infect unpatched systems
is likely to grow soon.
At present,
what we must do to avoid this nightmare is to _wake up_
and apply all available patches as soon as possible.
Individuals and organizations must always stay vigilant and up-to-date
with Windows security updates
to reduce critical risks and prevent falling victim to harmful attacks.

From `Fluid Attacks`,
we invite you to remember
that these are just a _few_ vulnerabilities
that may be identified within your systems.
