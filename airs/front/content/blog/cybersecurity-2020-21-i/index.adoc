= State of Cybersecurity 2020-21, I

This year 2020 has not had a similar close precedent,
with a link:https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019[COVID-19] spread worldwide affecting millions of people and,
linked to it, within our particular context as a red team,
considerable growth in the number of cyberattacks.
Due to isolation, virtual activities have increased
(e.g., learning, shopping, meeting, working).
Consequently, the areas of action for cybercriminals have expanded.

Let's start this first part of the State of Cybersecurity 2020-21
with some statistics that you may find a bit shocking:

- link:https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/01/22/microsoft-security-shocker-as-250-million-customer-records-exposed-online/?sh=d86a1954d1b3[A database with] *250 million* Microsoft customer records
was found exposed in January.
- link:https://www.csoonline.com/article/3153707/top-cybersecurity-facts-figures-and-statistics.html[In March, CSO reported] that *$17,700* are lost every minute
because of phishing attacks.
- According to CSO, *60%* of breaches involved vulnerabilities
for which the existing patch was not applied.
- link:https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach[The average time] to identify and contain a breach is *280* days.
- link:https://www.zdnet.com/article/dutch-government-loses-hard-drives-with-data-of-6-9-million-registered-donors/[The Dutch government] lost hard drives
with the personal data of approximately *7 million* organ donors.

were released in the first half of this year.
- link:https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2020-main-incidents[*84%* of cyberattacks] are based on social engineering.

== A useful coronavirus for cybercriminals

Taking advantage not only of curiosity
but also of uncertainty and fear generated by the pandemic,
malicious hackers have revitalized social engineering attacks,
many times oriented to the theft of sensitive data,
which were apparently link:https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/cybercrime-review-hackers-great-covid-19-cash-in-a-15037[in some decline].
For instance, link:https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/493198-fbi-sees-spike-in-cyber-crime-reports-during-coronavirus-pandemic[the FBI reported] some months ago that
the number of cybersecurity complaints they received
was as high as *4,000* a day.
A far cry from the *1,000* daily complaints
they received before the pandemic.
Criminals have been able to scam many people
with coronavirus-related link:../phishing/[phishing] emails
containing links to fake login pages or malware to download
link:https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Joint%20Advisory%20COVID-19%20exploited%20by%20malicious%20cyber%20actors%20V1.pdf[as if they were sent by trusted entities]
(e.g., the World Health Organization)
or link:https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Joint%20Advisory%20COVID-19%20exploited%20by%20malicious%20cyber%20actors%20V1.pdf[by internal departments] of an organization to their employees.
As another example, in the middle of this year,
link:https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/06/16/exploiting-a-crisis-how-cybercriminals-behaved-during-the-outbreak/[Microsoft even reported] that these COVID-19 themed attacks
reached between *20,000* and *30,000* a day only in the US.

Hackers —who keep monetization as their main motivation—
have even increased attempts to breach healthcare organizations.
link:https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/cybersecurity-essentials/new-healthcare-report-reveals-cyber-threats-trends-and-transformations[These become easier targets]
with highly stressed and busy people,
focused on responding to or fighting against COVID-19.
(Some of these attacks, highly planned and prepared,
could even be aimed at link:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/top-cyber-security-experts-report-4-000-cyber-attacks-a-day-since-covid-19-pandemic-301110157.html[theft of research data]
desired by major organizations.)
As reported by link:https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2020-main-incidents[ENISA]
(European Union Agency for Cybersecurity),
it has occurred, for instance, with link:../ransomware/[ransomware] incidents.
According to link:https://monstercloud.com/blog/2020/03/23/coronavirus-alert-ransomware-attacks-up-by-800/[Zohar Pinhasi],
a cyber counter-terrorism expert,
this type of attack rose by *800%* at the start of this year.

Malicious hackers and cybercriminals have also managed
to pursue and attack multiple firms and government agencies
in the midst of unexpected transitioning to remote working and cloud computing.
In the previous year, according to link:https://medium.com/@ARIACyberSec/second-half-of-2020-cybersecurity-trends-181211f98f2e[ARIA on Medium],
about *43%* of Americans _occasionally_ worked from home.
But as of early May of this year,
*85%* worked remotely _full_ time
—sometimes unsafely using home networks and their own devices.
Additionally, about *90%* of companies
currently make use of some cloud service, as reported by link:https://www.cyvolve.com/resources/content-library/reports/state-of-cybersecurity-report-2020/[Cyvolve].

This accelerated digital transformation, especially for complex systems,
obviously meant chaos and high risks.
The pressure to keep businesses active,
in some instances coupled with ignorance and negligence
in terms of cybersecurity,
led to the establishment of many networks or infrastructures
that were poorly or erroneously configured, link:https://www.securityweek.com/back-basics-pandemic-cybersecurity-trends-and-solutions[overlooking security protocols].
As a result, criminals have succeeded
in link:https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Joint%20Advisory%20COVID-19%20exploited%20by%20malicious%20cyber%20actors%20V1.pdf[exploiting diverse publicly known vulnerabilities]
in networks and other remote working tools
and have even targeted communication platforms
that are widely used today (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Zoom).
All this without leaving aside the human factor,
in this case concerning employees.
They have been seen as a preliminary target
in social engineering attacks on firms,
link:https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/cybercrime-review-hackers-great-covid-19-cash-in-a-15037[especially in the middle market].
A big mistake in this market —also considering small entities—
is to believe that cybersecurity is usually an exclusive problem
for large organizations, such as banks and governments.

== Cybercriminals up to speed on IT

Today, cybercriminals have also been flexible enough
to respond to global trends regarding the implementation
and use of new technologies and techniques.
As an example is something that link:https://techyguru2021.medium.com/top-3-cybersecurity-trends-4d6b80af5545[Tech Guru] shares
concerning advances in the automotive field:
new vehicles can be equipped "with automatic software
for cruise control drivers, engine timing, door lock, airbags,
and advanced driver assistance systems that enable smooth communication."
The problem arises because these cars employ standard connection systems
such as WiFi and Bluetooth and end up being exposed to cyber threats.

Another trend targeted by cybercriminals
is undoubtedly the widespread and growing use of mobile devices.
link:https://chrishtopher-henry-38679.medium.com/cybersecurity-trends-to-watch-out-in-2020-278bc41200ed[More and more business data]
is now being stored on these devices.
Following link:https://www.statista.com/statistics/245501/multiple-mobile-device-ownership-worldwide/#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20mobile%20devices,to%2014.91%20billion%20by%202021.[Statista's data],
"the number of mobile devices worldwide in 2020 stood at 14.02 billion,
with forecasts suggesting this is likely to rise to 14.91 billion by 2021."
Likewise, the number of threats to each type of file and procedure
we perform on these daily use machines has increased.
As link:https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/358776[Kaushik comments in Entrepreneur],
"there are several ways in which mobile phones could be attacked:
phishing or more specifically SMiShing (through SMS),
broken cryptography or weak encryption algorithms, network spoofing,
inappropriate session handling entailing apps
sharing session tokens with malicious actors,
riskware causing data leakage and spyware."

Moreover, we're at a time where link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G[5G],
"the fifth generation technology standard for broadband cellular networks,"
is beginning to expand.
Billions of devices will be connected through this medium
with greater bandwidth than their predecessors
for countless personal, commercial and industrial activities
with lots of applications.
This is something that hackers are also aware of,
namely the copious number of entry points
that will become available to cyberattacks
on the link:https://chrishtopher-henry-38679.medium.com/top-cybersecurity-trends-to-watch-for-in-2020-e1fd38bfa85b[Internet of Things with low or no security] devices and networks.

On the other hand, this year has also highlighted
the prominence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).
Everyone is talking about it.
And while many organizations have obtained benefits from each of these fields,
it is also true that malicious hackers do not intend to be left behind.
They have seen new opportunities here to transform
and strengthen their attacks and make them more abundant and sophisticated.
That is the case, for example, with AI fuzzing,
which, according to link:https://www.cyvolve.com/resources/content-library/reports/state-of-cybersecurity-report-2020/[Cyvolve],
"couples traditional fuzzing methods of detecting system vulnerabilities
with AI, that can be exploited by cybercriminals to launch zero-day attacks."
For ML, there are cases like that in which the retraining of the systems
is achieved through poisoned data sources,
and the backdoor attacks, "which can fundamentally rewrite
the model's functionalities or even skew data."

Before finishing this part of the State of Cybersecurity 2020-21,
to keep in mind what you or your company may face at present,
here is the list of top 15 threats reported by link:https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-threat-landscape-2020[ENISA]
