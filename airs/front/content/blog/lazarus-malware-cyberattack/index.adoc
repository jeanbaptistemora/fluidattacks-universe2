= Lazarus, Come Forth!

This week several cybersecurity portals (see

and link:https://cutt.ly/6n06X4R[securelist])
confirmed that *North Korea* has built a *campaign of cyberattacks*
targeting South Korea.
Its goal? link:https://cutt.ly/vn06BvD[Spy on]
high-profile government officials,
financial institutions, banking organizations,
and government administrative offices of the highest level
such as the Korea Internet and Security Agency (KISA),
the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
the South Korean Embassy of Sri Lanka,
the Deputy Consul General at Korean Consulate General in Hong Kong,
educational centers such as Seoul National University,
the country's largest university and one of the Top 50 universities worldwide
(according to
link:https://cutt.ly/8n2wUzc[QS ranking]). They
have even targeted global organizations such as the
International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Security Officer.

The
link:https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/park-jin-hyok[FBI]
has acknowledged the link that North Korean hacking groups
have had with conspiracy campaigns orchestrated by that Government.
In addition, the
link:https://cutt.ly/Hn2wnzA[U.S. Department of the Treasury]
has identified these groups as state-sponsored.
But who are these groups? Who are their victims, and why?
Are they a global threat?

== Lazarus
One of the most famous North Korean criminal gangs is *Lazarus*.
It has been operating since at least
link:https://cutt.ly/Cn2rnuF[2009].
However, the U.S. Department of the Treasury
link:https://cutt.ly/Hn2wnzA[insists]
it was created by the North Korean government
in 2007 and is run by the country's security service,
the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB).
The RGB is in charge of the country's cyber activities and is
"link:https://cutt.ly/Hn2wnzA[involved in the trade
of North Korean arms]."

It was
link:https://cutt.ly/tn061M7[recently confirmed]
that WannaCry, a malware
link:https://cutt.ly/1n2wvpu[used to extort money],
was used against Japanese multinational company *Sony*
in an attack that costed more than
link:https://cutt.ly/tn061M7[$1B]
in 2014. Apparently, the attack was retaliation for
link:https://cutt.ly/tn061M7[Sony's film]
link:https://cutt.ly/Tn2wxFJ[_The Interview_],
a comedy that ridiculed dictator Kim Jong Un.
The attack
link:https://cutt.ly/Wn2wl7V[perpetrated by Lazarus],
in any case, was not limited to Sony but also targeted
international banks and cryptocurrency companies.

In 2017, the same malware infected more than
link:https://cutt.ly/vn2wj3n[300 thousand]
computers and impacted at least 150 countries worldwide,
including the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand
and the United Kingdom.
The attack was particularly striking for having reached the
"link:https://cutt.ly/Hn2wnzA[hospital systems]
in the United Kingdom, Russia's interior ministry,
FedEx in the U.S., Germany's rail network,
a Spanish telecommunications operator and major companies in Asia."
It was undoubtedly a media attack because of its impact
and the variety of companies and organizations affected.
Yet, we had to wait two years after the attack
until the U.S. Department of the Treasury
link:https://cutt.ly/Hn2wnzA[confirmed]
that "Lazarus Group was involved in the destructive
WannaCry 2.0 ransomware attack" aforementioned.

== Organization
In the
link:https://cutt.ly/zn2wfZ0[white paper]
that link:https://www.lexfo.fr/en/[Lexfo],
a recognized french technical expertise firm in computer security,
presented on Lazarus, it was concluded that they are not a single group.
Instead, the cybercriminal gang has subdivisions
in charge of attacking from different fronts:
"the Lazarus 'core' aiming at disrupting activities and causing damage,
*Andariel*, hacking for profit and intelligence, and *Bluenoroff*,
motivated by financial gains" (my emphasis).
Andariel has been the most prominent part of Lazarus dedicated to
link:https://cutt.ly/fn06kPV[targeting
South Korean entities with malware attacks].

As a case study, Lazarus is quite particular because
link:https://cutt.ly/Hn2wnzA[it is
directly controlled]
by a North Korean government entity.
This is astonishing because there are not many cases
of public relationships between cybercriminal gangs and governments.
Perhaps Russian groups are the most famous cases,
but we still don't have official communication
from the Russian government that publicly accepts they work together.
In this way, Lazarus operations make it a peculiar state-owned company,
which resorts to cybercrime to commit its misdeeds.
Yet, it has little autonomy to carry out its criminal activities.
But how can we explain this unusual formation of a criminal group?

== The North Korean case
For many years now,
North Korea has been subject to several economic sanctions.
Since 2006, the
link:https://www.un.org/press/en/2006/sc8853.doc.htm[United Nations]
has unanimously condemned the nuclear tests
being executed by the Democratic Republic of Korea.
For this reason, dozens of
link:https://cutt.ly/In2wsTp[economic sanctions]
were carried out, orchestrated primarily by the United States,
as North Korea is seen as
link:https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL31696.pdf[posing a threat
to U.S. national security].
These *economic pressures* are intended to *constrain*
the Asian nation from *denuclearizing*.
Unfortunately, denuclearization has not been achieved,
and the North Korean nuclear arsenal has been
link:https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41174689[strengthened] recently.

Given this background, it is not hard to think
that North Korea has implemented methods to secure capital
in 'unorthodox' ways.
Hence, the relationship that the RGB has with Lazarus is not strange.
Therefore,
"link:https://cutt.ly/fn06kPV[North
Korea has been behind an increasingly orchestrated effort
aimed at infiltrating computers of financial institutions]"
to perform
link:https://cutt.ly/Rn2wpBb[cryptocurrency heists]
or ransomware attacks.
Specifically, with WannaCry,
their goal is to use malware to steal data and spy on competitors.
In particular,
link:https://cutt.ly/fn06kPV[Andariel has been responsible for]
"attempting to steal bank card information by hacking into ATMs
to withdraw cash or sell customer information on the black market."

== Go round in circles?
This is a vicious circle.
Instead of making the Asian country less and less
threatening to the international community,
what economic blockades do is push the government
to finance itself in illegal ways that risk the finances,
cybersecurity and privacy of other nations.
That, in turn, leads to increasingly strong sanctions
on the part of the international community.
One of the highest points of Lazarus'
criminal shots was the ambitious Bangladesh Central Bank attack in 2016.
The Korean gang attempted to steal more than
link:https://cutt.ly/Yn2wq5Z[$850M].
The action was almost entirely thwarted
but cost the Bangladeshi institution $81M,
a figure reduced to $63M after
link:https://cutt.ly/dn2wiZa[$18M]
were recovered.

That same year the administration of
then-President Barack Obama announced its
link:https://cutt.ly/Fn2wyv0[Executive Order 13722 of March 15, 2016].
President Obama established that,
due to North Korea's persistence in developing
its nuclear and missile programs,
the U.S. government recognizes the Asian country as a national priority.
That decision was supported considering
the rise of North Korean cybercriminal activities that targeted European,
American, and Asian countries.
As a result, it prohibited any direct or indirect
commercial exchange with every type of North Korean company.

Given these circumstances,
it is not surprising that North Korea
is focused on financing groups whose objective is to steal,
defraud, and procure large amounts of money illegally.
Hence statements such as
link:https://cutt.ly/fn06kPV[Seongsu Park],
Kaspersky Senior Security Researcher, make sense:
"The Andariel group [...]
have underlined their place as a financially motivated state-sponsored actor."
The case of Andariel, or what in practical terms is the same,
Lazarus, is much more problematic than that of
link:../ransomware-as-a-service/[RaaS] organizations such as
link:../jbs-revil-cyberattack/[REvil],
or criminal gangs like
link:../pipeline-ransomware-darkside/[DarkSide]
or link:../spectre/[Spectre] because
they are being funded by the Korean government itself.
One more reason to be prepared and to take
link:../optimism-bias/[cybersecurity with the attention it deserves].
You don't have to wait for these types of attacks
to occur in order to realize that *it's necessary to protect your systems*.
