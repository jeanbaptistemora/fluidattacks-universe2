= Alert! "Invisible" Doors Opened

You have one or several digital services
that can be reached from anywhere over the Internet.
You might have as well one or more wireless devices
allowing employees to access corporate services
and visitors to access resources on the Internet.
These are just two examples
of how information technology enables organizations
to run their operations broadly.
In either case,
there is something essential to do daily:
checking whether the software components
allowing users to do their work
are updated and free of vulnerabilities.

Recently,
link:https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-209a[the alert AA21-209A] was published
on the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) website,
coauthored by this organization
and other American, Australian, and British agencies.
The message is simple:
*there are a bunch of known vulnerabilities
that are being routinely exploited*.

In that document,
you can find the details of these vulnerabilities
affecting the software of many world-renowned vendors
like Microsoft, VMware, and Fortinet,
to name a few.
Want to prevent a hack or data breach?
Have a look at the list,
and make sure you have addressed these CVEs.
But,
don't stop there:
make sure your organization has a process
to continuously check whether your software,
especially the components that can be reached from the Internet
or by visitors or intruders in your corporate network,
is free from known vulnerabilities.

== Types of these often-exploited vulnerabilities

In our work with many organizations,
we routinely find software components
that are vulnerable to known exploits.
We always provide our customers with the information
to address these weaknesses
over the systems they entrust us for hacking.
This is the main reason we wrote this piece:
aligned with the alert,
we have evidence
that organizations may be more exposed than they think
with the outdated software they might have,
but this is something they fail to address quickly.

.Top Routinely Exploited CVEs in 2020 (Source: link:https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-209a[Alert AA21-209A - Top Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities]).

What are these exposures?
Let's make a summary of what is in the alert document.

- *Path traversal*
(see `Fluid Attacks` Documentation:
link:https://docs.fluidattacks.com/criteria/vulnerabilities/063[Path Traversal]).
In short,
a software component can be hacked
if it allows accessing files
that are not supposed to be accessed.
By using strings like `../`
(a string used as a command
to navigate across folders in an operative system),
attackers can bypass the boundaries of the software
and gain access to sensitive information or functionalities.

- *Remote code execution*
(see `Fluid Attacks` Documentation:
link:https://docs.fluidattacks.com/criteria/vulnerabilities/004/[RCE]).
This weakness allows,
literally,
the execution of code remotely.
If a software component is vulnerable to this sort of flaw,
unexpected actions can be triggered
by an internal or external attacker.

- *Elevation of privileges*
(see `Fluid Attacks` Documentation:
link:https://docs.fluidattacks.com/criteria/vulnerabilities/005[privilege escalation]).
Usually,
a wrong configuration enables users
to assign themselves somehow
rights they shouldn't have.
For instance,
a bank sales representative might leverage this flaw
to give more resources or authorizations
than they should in their role.

Think of any of these weaknesses;
they could be present in your IT assets at some point.
It might take just one of these
to gain access to a corporate network
and,
for instance,
silently leak confidential data.
Also,
it is not very difficult to think
about a ransomware attack.

Closing these "invisible" doors
could make a significant contribution
in managing operational and organizational risk.
The steps that can be taken to prevent the abuse of IT assets
from these vulnerabilities
could save a lot of effort and money for organizations.
Furthermore,
these steps would preserve the goodwill of their brands.

== Cybersecurity is a process and should be layered

Why is it essential to have continuous checks?
Because cybersecurity is not an end,
and threats are evolving so fast
that everything is becoming more digital
and software-mediated.
Have a look at the MIT Technology Review article
"link:https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/23/1036140/2021-record-zero-day-hacks-reasons/[2021 has broken the record for zero-day hacking attacks]."
These numbers are worrisome,
and we should ask ourselves
how many vulnerabilities are out there silently harming.
Organizations need to focus
on what they can have control of
and do it quickly.

Also,
organizations must bear in mind that
cybersecurity is not concentrated in one or two places.
Quite the opposite:
cybersecurity is distributed or layered.
Although we have emphasized outdated software here,
other IT and business environment components
should also be addressed as attack surfaces.
For example,
there are cases in which one information resource is,
by omission,
published on the Internet,
and only that allows an attacker to gain access
to a supposedly protected network.
Layered cybersecurity is critical
to ensure availability is preserved,
as well as integrity and confidentiality.
Companies must check
whether different layers of protection are fully working.

Companies can have comprehensive support in this endeavor
from other expert organizations
across all of their IT assets
or cover at least the most critical ones.
This is usually more efficient and desirable,
as the independence of the third party ensures
the disclosure of all flaws
for the betterment of the organization.

== What can Fluid Attacks do for you?

`Fluid Attacks` focus on attacking systems link:../../services/continuous-hacking/[continuously]
for proactive defense.
Our tests are performed constantly,
considering the changes made in the source code,
the deployed applications,
and the infrastructure.

We aim to find all vulnerabilities
that exist across the software development lifecycle.
Yes,
we can start checking for vulnerabilities right away
when you have just begun developing your software.
We employ several techniques
like static code review,
looking for coding practices that inject vulnerabilities,
and dynamic penetration testing
over deployed applications and infrastructure.
In this last scenario,
the interaction between infrastructure and application
might lead to other vulnerabilities
not visible in the source code.
Thus,
it is a comprehensive approach.

Organizations of all sizes can benefit from our approach
by precisely doing what we suggest in this article:
closing the "invisible doors."
Our mission is to point out to our customers
where these doors are
and provide them with the information
to close them effectively.
We also run tests
to check whether fixes have been successful.
