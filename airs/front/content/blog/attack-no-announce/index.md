We talk a lot about the advantages of extreme connectivity
and information availability,
but so little about how our company's data,
client's data,
or even personal data is secured.
Here we want to guide you about some management policies
we suggest that you could take in advance
to be able to answer with high precision
how secure your information is,
how effective your defense measurements are,
and also what could happen if you don't apply these policies.

From our experience,
we know that company heads usually assume that
"buying more technology" should solve all their security problems.
Such a solution is,
in fact,
the main cause of the issue,
because poorly implemented, built, or configured technology
is the source of all vulnerabilities.

For modern companies,
protecting their information by making it inaccessible,
hiding it,
or keeping it on paper is no longer a viable option.
In a world where digital transformation is the norm,
exposing more information to the client is a must.
This transformation's benefits go from improving times and transaction costs,
to the rising of service windows and client satisfaction.
Operations
that were only possible on-site during office hours
are now 24 hours a day,
7 days a week,
all year long.

However,
these benefits bring new possible dangers:
Can the buyer modify the product price before paying for it?
Can an employee know the salary changes of his coworkers?
Can members of the labor union read board minutes?
Can a guest get network administrator passwords?
Can someone connect to the enterprise network,
turn on a mic on the manager's computer,
and listen to conversations?
Can a client modify the website of my company?
Can I check the medical record of another person from the internet?

## Securing your organization

The question "how secure is my organization" is answered
by making real (well meant) attacks;
this goes by many names:
[ethical hacking](../../solutions/ethical-hacking/),
[penetration testing](../../solutions/penetration-testing/)
and [red teaming](../../solutions/red-teaming/),
among others.
The first policy we recommend is:

1. **Continuous attacks** on your organization,
    in order to find vulnerabilities
    that allow malicious attackers to take control of your information.
    The word 'Continuous' means that
    these exercises must be performed
    with a specific and immovable frequency
    (quarterly, biannual, etc.).
    When this policy isn't clear,
    organizations tend to stop further attacks
    with the excuse of being unable to fix the vulnerabilities found
    in the previous cycle.
    Once your organization's policies evolve
    into periodic exercises of continuous attacks,
    the next policy is to do them quietly and unexpectedly.

2. **Zero-knowledge attacks**.
    It makes no sense that the ones who attack (red team)
    perform the test when the defenders (blue team)
    are aware of these intrusions' time and place.
    It's absurd for red team members to report advances
    or ask for permission
    (in the scope of these attacks)
    from blue team members,
    someone within the organization
    that could have links with defense software/hardware vendors or bosses
    that might be compromised.
    In order to know with certainty the security level of your company,
    these exercises must be as close to reality as possible.
    In real life,
    a malicious attacker will not notify when,
    how, and where he might attack,
    what techniques he might be using,
    what the penetration level is,
    what machines he owns,
    and what information has been disclosed.
    Because of this,
    we must maintain a minimum privilege information disclosure
    about the test.
    Only a minimum amount of personnel should know about it.
    This is known as a zero-knowledge policy.

    This policy implies that
    those responsible for the security of organizations
    shouldn't be the ones who organize and coordinate an ethical hacking test.
    This is due to a possible tendency for them,
    with the information of the attack,
    to prepare for it unrealistically,
    limit its scope to strong zones,
    and filter out critical vulnerabilities to their managers
    to avoid risking their current positions.
    Even though it's now a trend to have Purple Teams,
    a combination of attackers and defenders,
    we should clearly define our objective:
    knowing precisely the security level.
    The existence of these mixed teams
    creates the possibility of polluting test results
    because these teams create a conflict of interest
    in the company's organizational design.
    Proceeding with the last policy brings an outstanding advantage:
    knowing your organization's real detection and reaction skills
    in the event of an attack.
    If the blue team doesn't know
    if the attacker is a 'white hat' hacker
    (members on red teams are these type of hackers)
    or a 'black hat' hacker (a malicious one),
    they will always be in a state of alert
    and will respond according to the defined procedures until the end:
    blocking, reporting, handling incidents, etc.
    The following is our third policy:

3. **React until the end** to every detection,
    without taking into account the hacker's intentions.
    This approach keeps the incident response engine oiled
    and well maintained,
    allows to test the quality of the hired red team,
    measures the efficiency of your investments on defense,
    and finally helps you achieve cost reductions
    or apply penalties that,
    after some frequency,
    make the attacking exercise pay for itself.

    <div class="title">

    </div>

    </div>

    The direct implication of the last two policies is our next policy:

4. **Total intrusion:**
    The red team must have a complete authorization on paper,
    email, and all forms of legal protection,
    from the highest authority of the company
    (CEO or manager)
    to do any offensive tactic,
    i.e., get any information, modify any data,
    access any workstation, or shut down any service.
    Everything should be allowed to ensure maximum criticality
    and compromise security at the highest level.
    If this policy isn't in place,
    the red team that you hired will have their hands tied
    and not be allowed to find real vulnerabilities,
    explore existing paths that a malicious attacker might walk,
    and show you your real security flaws.
    In the end,
    if on the ethical hacking tests
    they don't find anything significant,
    it surely will be due to the limitations
    that you imposed on the red team,
    and your doubts
    on whether your security is genuine or fake
    will rise.
    As a final point,
    we want to invite you
    to one of the most forgotten aspects of the ethical hacking tests:

5. **Coherence policy:**
    If you ask a manager
    "Between availability or confidentiality,
    what is most important?"
    Most of the time,
    the answer will be both.
    But if you ask
    "Will you shut down your servers
    given the presence of an attacker?"
    Saying yes to that question puts confidentiality above availability.
    The answer
    that you will find
    is that managers would rather maintain their servers on
    and try to deal with the attacker.
    It is common for most organizations
    to have availability higher than confidentiality and integrity
    in the precedence list.
    It is paradoxical that,
    even though availability is the most important of the triad,
    they won't authorize red teams to test DoS
    (denial of service)
    attacks survival rate.
    In this case,
    the invitation is the following:
    turn your restrictions into encouragement to attack
    for the red team.
    In this way,
    you can verify with an ally
    how vulnerable your company is to malicious attackers.

## Conclusion

With these simple policies,
**continuous attacks**, **zero-knowledge**,
**react until the end**, **total intrusion** and **coherence**,
you can know how secure your systems really are,
improve your security at vertiginous rates
and save money by not buying technologies
that generate huge and incomprehensive vulnerability reports,
many of those with false positives
and a lack of context
about their real impact on your organization.
