= Don't Give Yourself to the Darkside

In this blog, we will not delve into Colonial Pipelines,
though we will mention some details about them.
Instead, our spotlight will be
the self-appointed criminal gang called DarkSide,
which was behind the attack.
How they operate, who they are, and, more importantly,
how can your company avoid becoming a victim of such an attack?

== What happened?

The FBI confirmed that on May 7th,
the Colonial Pipeline networks were attacked by the link:https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-statement-on-compromise-of-colonial-pipeline-networks[DarkSide ransomware] gang.
After that, the company link:https://www.reuters.com/technology/fireeye-shares-jump-after-pipeline-cyberattack-2021-05-10/[closed its complete network] for some days.
In fact, until the date this post is published,
link:https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/05/12/colonial-pipeline-hack-shutdown-gas-outages-refuel/5065013001/[the main pipeline is still shut].
However, link:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/colonial-pipeline-paid-hackers-nearly-5-million-in-ransom[it was known] that
the company already paid $5 million in cryptocurrency
link:https://www.zdnet.com/article/colonial-pipeline-paid-close-to-5-million-in-ransomware-blackmail-payment/?ftag=TRE-03-10aaa6b&bhid=29868913901264489308848757891800&mid=13366532&cid=2399622965[to decrypt locked systems].
(Which seems insignificant compared to the link:https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/colonial-pipeline-has-cyber-insurance-policy-sources-2021-05-13/[$15 million coverage
that their cyber-security insurance can cover]).

== Who are involved?

The Colonial Pipeline network
link:https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57063636[transports almost half] of the East Coast's fuel supply.
This is why link:https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colonial-pipeline-resumes-operations-cyberattack/[prices at the pumps increased] after the long-lasted cut.
In total, link:https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-colonial-pipeline-shutdown-is-causing-gasoline-shortages-11620898203[the pipeline network is 5,500 miles long],
which makes it the longest in the country (see Figure 1).

The pipeline's primary source is in Texas,
the state where, by far, stands the most significant number of refineries.
While link:https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-colonial-pipeline-shutdown-is-causing-gasoline-shortages-11620898203#:~:text=According%20to%20an%20Energy%20Department,a%20million%20barrels%20a%20day.[Texas has more than 20 refineries
with a total capacity less than a million barrels a day,
the whole East Coast has only seven].
Therefore, a disruption in the flow from that state
has paralyzed operations in several sectors
(link:https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-govt-top-fuel-supplier-work-secure-pipelines-closure-enters-4th-day-2021-05-10/[including seven of the largest airports in the country
and five military bases]; see Figure 2).

Let's talk about *DarkSide*.
It looks like they became public link:https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-new-targeted-ransomware-demands-million-dollar-ransoms/[in August of 2020],
and they were discovered link:https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/what-is-darkside-ransomware/[by MalwareHunterTeam] (see Figure 3).
DarkSide is perhaps link:https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/darkside-the-new-ransomware-group-behind-highly-targeted-attacks/[one of the most important exponents
of the rising Ransomware-as-a-Corporation] (RaaC) trend.
They differ from other ransomware criminal groups
in their victims' search method.
An ordinary criminal uses spoofing, link:../smishing/[smishing], or link:../phishing/[phishing],
waiting for a victim to take the bait.
Instead, DarkSide studies its potential victims carefully
by determining its economic activity, income, and expenses.
After that, they analyze the attack difficulty,
its success probability and inquire about the company's most vulnerable point
to start their attack from there.
Unlike well-known criminal groups
such as DoppelPaymer, Sodinokibi, link:https://statescoop.com/maze-ransomware-attackers-leak-data-stolen-from-suburban-washington-schools/[Maze], and NetWalker,
DarkSide is structured around a "link:https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/10/hacking-group-darkside-reportedly-responsible-for-colonial-pipeline-shutdown.html[business model]."
In addition, it is noticeable that link:https://www.cybereason.com/blog/cybereason-vs-darkside-ransomware[they have a code of ethics]
that prohibits them from attacking hospitals, schools, and government agencies.
link:https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54591761[It is also reported that] they look to obtain the most significant profit
by attacking big companies. At the same time,
link:https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54591761[they make donations using some of the money received through ransomware].
For example, they gave 10 thousand dollars to Children International
and another 10 thousand dollars to the Water Project Receipt in October 2020.
Both of them were rejected by the NGO's.

== How did it happen?

DarkSide infiltrated the Colonial Pipeline network
by blocking data from their computers and servers.
To unblock their data, the company must pay the money criminals asked for.
Specifically, they link:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-09/colonial-hackers-stole-data-thursday-ahead-of-pipeline-shutdown[stole 100 gigabytes of data
threatening to share it on the web].
Besides, though details are not precise,
link:https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/e/what-we-know-about-darkside-ransomware-and-the-us-pipeline-attac.html[their modus operandi starts] with (but is not limited to) a link:../phishing/[phishing] email
that tricked an employee.
Likewise, by using link:../importance-pentesting/[penetration testing] tools,
link:https://www.csoonline.com/article/3618688/darkside-ransomware-explained-how-it-works-and-who-is-behind-it.html?upd=1620908660505[they can perform lateral movements].
In addition, link:https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/10/us/politics/pipeline-hack-darkside.html[it can be assumed that] the attack was directed
to the commercial area and not the operational one.
Apparently, their goal was not to crash down the pipeline
but to extort the company to make money (as has been done in link:https://www.zdnet.com/article/darkside-the-ransomware-group-responsible-for-colonial-pipeline-cyberattack-explained/[previous cases]).
In this sense, their main attack is not so different
from the typical ransomware attack.

DarkSide gets data from their victims' servers,
encrypts them, uploads them to their leak-website
(which can only be accessed by search engines
that allow you to enter the link:../dark-web/[deep web] as Tor),
and then asks for the money to decrypt them.
The encryption is twofold; first, they use a link:https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/threat-center/threat-landscape-dashboard/ransomware-details.darkside-ransomware.html[SALSA20 key],
one of the fastest encryption on the market, and then use an RSA-1024 key.
Then, link:https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-new-targeted-ransomware-demands-million-dollar-ransoms/[they withdraw] data servers
and disable the link:https://github.com/k-vitali/Malware-Misc-RE/blob/master/2020-08-21-crime_darkside_ransomware.vk.notes.raw[termination of specific processes].
Finally, every file link:https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/what-is-darkside-ransomware/[extension changes to .DarkSide]
and any of them open link:https://www.pcrisk.com/removal-guides/18504-darkside-ransomware[an executable
that redirects to .txt with the following text]:

."Welcome to Dark."
image::https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1621039652/blog/pipeline-ransomware-darkside/image4_syrgzj.webp[Figure 4]

link:https://malwarewarrior.com/how-to-remove-darkside-ransomware-and-decrypt-darkside-files/[The gang lists all types of stolen data
and sends] a "personal website" URL to their victim.
Data is already loaded and expected to be published automatically
if the company does not pay before the deadline.
If that is not enough,
they also threaten to delete that information from the victim's network.
In fact, in a press release posted on a Tor website in August 2020,
link:https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/darkside-the-new-ransomware-group-behind-highly-targeted-attacks/[they announce that].

."If you refuse to pay."

== What have we learned?

link:https://edition.cnn.com/videos/politics/2021/05/10/colonial-pipeline-white-house-biden-sot-vpx.cnn/video/playlists/this-week-in-politics/[President Biden himself said] he is now very interested
in the cyberattack situation.
In fact, on Wednesday, May 12th,
link:https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/[the White House released an Executive Order]
in which they declare that the Federal Government is going to:
"improve its efforts to identify, deter, protect against, detect, and respond
to these actions and actors."
The extensive document is clearly motivated by the DarkSide attack,
but also by recent ones
(surely the link:../exchange-server-hack/[hack to Microsoft Exchange Server],
the link:../solarwinds-attack/[SolarWinds security fiasco], or the link:../facebook-data-leak/[Facebook Data Leak]).

This means US law enforcement
link:https://grahamcluley.com/darkside-ransomware-gang-fear/["are likely to be putting significant resources
into uncovering" their identity].
So, it should not be surprising that Congressman Jim Langevin (D-RI),
chair of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Cybersecurity,
Innovative Technologies, and Information Systems link:https://langevin.house.gov/press-release/langevin-praises-sweeping-biden-executive-actions-cybersecurity[has said]:
"Cybersecurity is the most urgent
national security challenge facing our nation,
and I applaud President Biden for taking action early in his term
to address and eliminate glaring vulnerabilities."

For all this, it seems that DarkSide regrets the social harm
caused by their criminal activity.
We can assume that not only for their "ethical code"
but also because they are now in the limelight.
In this respect, what Nicole Perlroth, a New York Times cybercrime reporter,
said last link:https://twitter.com/nicoleperlroth/status/1391794316507418624?s=20[Monday] turns very interesting:

We also learned that ransomware can jeopardize
link:https://www.zdnet.com/article/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-attack-everything-you-need-to-know/[companies and the infrastructure] of an entire country.
This means, in turn, that companies and governments
must reinforce their cybersecurity systems.
Because link:https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1602649[*they're not paying enough attention to these risks*]:
"the ONG (Oil & Natural Gas) industry is unaware
of potentially useful technologies that have been developed
for ensuring cyber-security of other infrastructure systems,
such as the electric grid."

link:https://www.secureworldexpo.com/industry-news/colonial-pipeline-poor-cybersecurity[Robert Smallwood was one of the consultants]
who delivered an 89-page report in January 2018
after conducting a six-month audit.
He said last Wednesday that the deficiencies and vulnerabilities
in the cybersecurity system
were so high that "link:https://apnews.com/article/va-state-wire-technology-business-1f06c091c492c1630471d29a9cf6529d[an eighth-grader could have hacked into that system]."
All of this resulted in a costly and embarrassing lesson:
prevention in terms of cybersecurity risks is very important.
Never take it lightly. Otherwise, there will be no guarantee
that you will not be attacked by the DarkSide.

For now, we'll just recommend you what they say throughout the Galaxy:
may the force be with you.
