= Web Apps Are to Tackle a New Order

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)
Top 10 is a ranking of the most critical security risks
to web applications.
It was first created as an awareness document,
with the objective of motivating software developers
to produce more secure code.
Today,
its importance is so huge
that it's considered a requirements document
when it comes to web application security.

This year's new installment is the result of applying a new methodology
and name changes,
merging categories and finding new ones.
Most importantly,
it has revealed a new order
that highlights different issues,
like secure design and threat modeling.

== New times call for new ways

This year's Top 10 is based on a massive amount of data
provided by different sources since 2017.
The sources were as varied as organizations doing internal testing,
organizations that test vendors by trade
and bug bounty vendors.
But,
in a refreshing way,
this installment now acknowledges the importance of the input
provided by application security
and development experts.
The reason is that they have proven to be aware of trends
that are not in the data produced by automated tools.
These trends may be found
only with new creative ways of testing,
which take time to integrate into tools and processes.
So,
leaving the expert's account out of the list
may result in an outdated ranking,
which is not the point of the Top 10 at all.
With this reason in mind,
two of the categories in the list
came from the results of a community survey
asking experts
what they see as essential weaknesses
that may not yet be found in the data.

As in 2017,
the new installment used data
that was collected and analyzed
along the lines of incidence rate.
This means that instead of counting every time
a vulnerability shows up in a single application,
it would only be counted as one.
This seems to resolve the problem
that some vulnerabilities
that appear a ton of times in automated tools
obscure the importance of some other serious vulnerabilities.
Additionally,
in 2021,
a change in data collection was made,
so that organizations could provide more data
on Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs),
that is,
categories of unknown custom weaknesses.
Instead of being provided a restricted list of CWE categories to report,
organizations were able to report any new weaknesses
without restrictions.

Another noticeable difference is the change
in some categories' names.
These changes mirror an increased interest in the root cause
as opposed to the symptoms.
The rationale behind this is that,
by conceding more visibility to the root causes,
more attention can be directed to identification and remediation.

== A new order

.OWASP Top 10 link:https://owasp.org/Top10/A00_2021_Introduction/[2017 and 2021 comparison] (taken from link:https://owasp.org/Top10/assets/mapping.png[owasp.org]).

The new Top 10 shows how,
as technology and development styles evolve,
risks have increased or decreased.
In a worryingly impressive climb to the first place
from its previous spot at number five,
link:https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/[Broken Access Control] is the riskiest security flaw.
This means that developers are failing
to implement proper access control
and testing its functionality.
The situation is not pretty,
with the worsening of the next category,
link:https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/[Cryptographic Failures],
previously known as Sensitive Data Exposure,
its consequence.
It shows that more effort should be put
into identifying sensitive information
and protecting it with up-to-date encryption techniques.

Although link:https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/[Injection] had its thunder stolen by the previous two,
it keeps being extremely problematic.
It has link:https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/152.html[many faces],
which have been recognized
in previous installments of the Top 10.
It had been number one for a whole decade
and now even includes link:https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A7_2017-Cross-Site_Scripting_(XSS).html[Cross-Site Scripting].
The risk of Injection persists
as developers still use interpreters,
where the mixing of code and data is very common
and results in vulnerabilities.

The highest-ranking of this year's new additions is link:https://owasp.org/Top10/A04_2021-Insecure_Design/[Insecure Design],
in fourth place.
It refers to the lack of security controls
to defend against attacks
and failure to establish a secure development lifecycle.
This flaw should not be taken lightly.
There is a huge overlap with higher rated risks,
like Broken Access Control
and Cryptographic Failures,
and some that are not so high up,
like Identification and Authentication Failures.
These risks are part of an insecure design.
This means that now,
more than ever,
implementing secure design is not an option;
it's a must.
What developers should achieve is,
following OWASP's recommendation,
"a culture and methodology
that constantly evaluates threats
and ensures that code is robustly designed and tested
to prevent known attack methods."
This calls for the importance of link:https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling[threat modeling],
defined by OWASP
as "a view of the application and its environment
through the lens of security."

Moving down the list,
link:https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/[Security Misconfiguration] went up one place
and appears merged with the XML External Entities (link:https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A4_2017-XML_External_Entities_(XXE).html[XXE])
improper restriction issue,
which is also considered a problem of configuration.
This and the following category,
link:https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/[Vulnerable and Outdated Components],
which moved up several places
and had its name revamped,
remind us of the growing importance
of properly configuring and upgrading
the application's components,
while also defending against attacks
where there are known vulnerabilities.

Number seven,
link:https://owasp.org/Top10/A07_2021-Identification_and_Authentication_Failures/[Identification and Authentication Failures],
previously known only as Broken Authentication,
poses at least a redeeming quality of development
over the last years.
Namely,
that this category's dramatic drop
from second place
means that the problem is being tackled,
perhaps through growing implementation of multi-factor authentication,
password complexity,
limited failed login attempts,
among others.

Another new addition,
at number eight,
seems to be motivated
by the appalling impact of the link:../solarwinds-attack/[SolarWinds security fiasco].
The risk of link:https://owasp.org/Top10/A08_2021-Software_and_Data_Integrity_Failures/[Software and Data Integrity Failures] urges developers
to verify integrity in the entire software build chain.
This not only means
that the components used to build the applications
should come from trusted sources
and be digitally signed.
It also means that attention should be directed
to how suppliers are managing their supply chain
to provide integrity to their software.
The merging of link:https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A8_2017-Insecure_Deserialization.html[Insecure Deserialization] with this category
stresses the importance of also ensuring data integrity
by validating almost every bit of data.

At number nine,
link:https://owasp.org/Top10/A09_2021-Security_Logging_and_Monitoring_Failures/[Security Logging and Monitoring Failures] had a subtle name change
and moved up one place.
This category was also supported
by the results from the community survey.
It reminds us of the importance of implementing run-time protection
to detect attacks
and create visibility into who is attacking,
which,
again,
brings us back to secure design.

The last new addition,
at number 10,
comes mainly from the community survey.
Experts are trying to raise awareness
that Server-Side Request Forgery (link:https://owasp.org/Top10/A10_2021-Server-Side_Request_Forgery_%28SSRF%29/[SSRF]) is a thing.
It happens when there is no proper validation of the user-supplied URL,
which allows the attacker
to make the application send a crafted request
to an unsuspecting destination.

That is the end of the list.
