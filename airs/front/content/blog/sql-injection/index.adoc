= Such as Microbes Getting Into You?

[quote]
Microbes have developed various ways of fooling the immune system
—by sending out confusing chemical signals, for instance,
or by disguising themselves as benign or friendly bacteria.
Some infectious agents [...]
can trick the immune system into attacking the wrong organisms.

Every person who frequently devotes their attention
to the field of cybersecurity
most certainly recognizes the *OWASP Top 10 Project*.
However, without leaving aside any reader engaged here,
we can say that what this standard link:https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/["represents]
[is] a broad consensus
about the most critical security risks to web applications."
This top 10 is an invaluable guide for software developers
in building secure code for organizations.
Through this standard,
developers can see the error of their ways
and make the necessary changes before a catastrophe.

Heading the link:https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/[OWASP Top Ten 2017],
link:https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Top_10-2017_%28en%29.pdf.pdf[according to variables] such as prevalence, detectability,
exploitability, and impact,
we find the web application security risk link:https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A1_2017-Injection[Injection].
Within this risk, we have SQL Injection,
our focal point in this new blog post.

== Wait, first, what's Injection?

In the Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (link:https://capec.mitre.org/index.html[CAPEC]),
"a community resource for identifying and understanding attacks,"
we find a list of attack patterns grouped among nine mechanisms.
One of them is the category called link:https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/152.html[Inject Unexpected Items].
There, the attack patterns
"focus on the ability to control or disrupt the behavior of a target
either through crafted data submitted via an interface for data input,
or the installation and execution of malicious code on the target system."
*That's Injection*.
The attacker can _inject_ input (including instructions) that,
in the interpretation of the application,
can provoke it to perform actions
far from the original purpose and reach instability.
Something that in similarity is not far
from what in the biological framework
some microorganisms can do with our immune system
(see link:https://www.amazon.com/Body-Guide-Occupants-Bill-Bryson/dp/0385539304[Bryson's book]).

Additionally,
within that mentioned category in CAPEC,
we have the "meta level attack pattern" link:https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/248.html[Command Injection].
There,
the attacker modifies an existing command string and,
consequently,
the interpretation of a downstream component of the application,
looking for particular responses.
The Command Injection is facilitated
by weaknesses in command building or input validation
and can culminate in exploitation.
This pattern is the "parent of" link:https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/136.html[LDAP], link:https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/250.html[XML] and other injections,
including the one that concerns us now: link:https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/66.html[SQL Injection].

== Ok, what's SQL Injection?

No, I think, for many of us,
we should first pose the following question:
What does SQL mean?
SQL refers to Structured Query Language,
link:http://www.sqlcourse.com/intro.html["the standard language] for relational database management systems" (RDBMSs).
It is used to establish communication with relational databases,
which can serve companies of all sizes
to store and analyze information
and as the back end for online applications.
So, through SQL statements, also called link:https://www.educative.io/blog/what-is-database-query-sql-nosql[_queries_],
in an RDBMS, we can retrieve, add, delete and update data of a database.
Nowadays,
link:https://www.statista.com/statistics/1131568/worldwide-popularity-ranking-relational-database-management-systems/[among the most commonly used] RDBMSs worldwide,
we can find Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.

Now, link:https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/66.html[as referenced in CAPEC],
the SQL Injection attack "exploits target software
that constructs SQL statements based on user input."
This kind of input can be,
for example,
your username and password to log in to a web application.
The attacker creates input strings
that within the application give rise to SQL statements
oriented to different actions from those already predefined.
Basically,
the attacker puts a metacharacter link:https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection["into data input]
to then place SQL commands in the control plane,
which did not exist there before."
That's why the consequent procedure gives unexpected results.

To enlighten you a bit more,
you can watch the example link:https://youtu.be/FHCTfA9cCXs?t=84[in this video].

As I said before,
this type of attack can occur
due to failures in the software for input validation.
In accordance with the corresponding weakness
listed as link:https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html[CWE-89] in the link:../../compliance/cwe/[Common Weakness Enumeration],
the application "does not neutralize
or incorrectly neutralizes special elements
that could modify the intended SQL command."
When the attacker introduces SQL syntax,
and the system does not validate it,
they can obtain multiple advantages thanks to the resulting queries.

Specifically,
thanks to a successful SQL Injection,
the attacker can access a system without previous knowledge of credentials
and can _interact_ with the database,
for instance,
to read sensitive information and modify it as they wish.
The attacker can also execute administration processes
(e.g., denial of services)
and sometimes even send commands to the operating system to compromise it.

I can't deny the surprise I felt
when I saw link:https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection#[what OWASP said] in addition to the above:
"The severity of SQL Injection attacks
is limited by the attacker's skill and imagination,
and to a lesser extent,
defense in depth countermeasures [...]."
What does this lead us to think?
Perhaps something like this:
If we are reckless enough to leave software vulnerable to SQL Injection,
we better pray
that it does not fall into the clutches of a clever malicious hacker.

== So, what can we do?

This vulnerability,
which is easy to detect and exploit,
can be avoided through several techniques
that we can see widely exposed
in the link:https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html[OWASP SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet].
However,
in order to give you an overview,
we can condense much of the information presented there.
As a first option,
we have the use of parameterized queries instead of dynamic queries.
This alternative forces developers to define the entire SQL code beforehand
so that only the required parameters are accepted
for query execution afterward.
Thus,
the database succeeds in distinguishing between code and data
for all types of inputs it receives.

As a close alternative to the previous approach,
perhaps with the same effectiveness,
we have the use of stored procedures.
Here,
developers define them and store them in the database itself
to be called from the application later.
They are not something that users are able to give as input.
A third strategy strongly linked to the previous ones
that can act as a complement
refers to link:https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html[input validation].
In this case,
criteria are created to detect unallowed data patterns
and prevent them from entering the application workflow.

Another option is offered by OWASP as a last resort,
apparently due to its weakness,
when it's impossible to use the above.
"This technique is to escape user input before putting it in a query."
Here,
the RDBMS allows some particular character escaping schemes
in specific queries
so as not to confuse the user input with the developer's SQL code.
Of course,
we cannot leave out an additional recommendation.
It is to keep the privileges of the database accounts
to the _minimum_ limit.
Users should have sufficient access permissions
to perform their predetermined tasks.
Thus,
for example,
who only needs to read all or just a portion of the database,
does not need permissions to add or delete information.

Finally,
at `Fluid Attacks`,
we recognize how the security of your web applications,
and consequently that of your company's and users' data,
can be affected
by the widely used and dangerous SQL Injection attack vectors.
That's why we help you identify with speed, accuracy,
and at the earliest stage
if your software is vulnerable to SQL Injection.
