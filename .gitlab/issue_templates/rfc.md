<!-- Issues are public, they should not contain confidential information -->

# Summary

<!-- One paragraph explanation of the feature. -->

# Motivation

<!-- Why are we doing this?
What use cases does it support?
What is the expected outcome? -->

# Detailed design

<!-- This is the core, normative part of the RFC.
Explain the design in enough detail
for somebody familiar with the ecosystem to understand, and implement.
This should get into specifics and corner-cases.
Yet, this section should also be terse,
avoiding redundancy even at the cost of clarity. -->

# Examples and Interactions

<!-- This section illustrates the detailed design.
This section should clarify all confusion
the reader has from the previous sections.
It is especially important to counterbalance
the desired terseness of the detailed design;
if you feel your detailed design is rudely short,
consider making this section longer instead. -->

# Drawbacks

<!-- Why should we not do this? -->

# Alternatives

<!-- What other designs have been considered?
What is the impact of not doing this? -->

# Unresolved questions

<!-- What parts of the design are still TBD or unknowns? -->

# Future work

<!-- What future work, if any,
would be implied
or impacted by this feature
without being directly part of the work? -->
