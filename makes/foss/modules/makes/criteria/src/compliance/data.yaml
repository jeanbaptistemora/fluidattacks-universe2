      FedRAMP is a U.S. Government program
      designed to standardize
      how the Federal Information Security Management Act
      (FISMA) applies to cloud computing services.
      It provides a standardized approach
      to security assessment,
      authorization and continuous monitoring
      of cloud-based services.

      FedRAMP defines a set of security control implementations
      and security impact level systems
      based on NIST baseline controls
      (NIST SP 800-53).

      The Brazilian General Data Protection Law
      (LGPD) can be considered as Brazil's answer to the GDPR
      —with the Brazilian law
      aligning with the European Regulation in many ways,
      while differing in others.
      The LGPD aims at creating a new legal framework
      for the use of personal data in Brazil,
      both online and offline,
      in the private and public sectors.
      The version used in this section is LGPD 2019.

      The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM)
      provides a methodology for the accurate characterization
      of operational security (OpSec)
      through examination and correlation of test results
      in a consistent way.
      It is one of the most complete
      and commonly used professional standards
      in security audits
      to review the security of systems
      from the internet.
      The version used in this section is OSSTMM 3.0,
      published on December 14, 2010.
