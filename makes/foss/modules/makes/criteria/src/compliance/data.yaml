      expanding the definition of “Private
      Information” and by adding “Data
      Breach Security Protections”.
      It has additional cybersecurity

      requirements in the event of a breach.

      The NYDFS Cybersecurity Regulation
      (23 NYCRR 500) is a set of regulations
      from the New York State Department of
      Financial Services (NYDFS) that places
      cybersecurity requirements on all
