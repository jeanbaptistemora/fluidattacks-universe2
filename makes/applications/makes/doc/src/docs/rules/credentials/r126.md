## Requirement

The system must provide a secure mechanism
to regenerate a user's password.

## Description

Passwords are identity assertion elements
that can be easily lost or forgotten.
Additionally, they can be leaked as a result of a user's actions
or a breach in the system.
Thus, systems should have a secure mechanism
that allows users to generate a new password in either of these scenarios.
Furthermore, none of these mechanisms
should send a recovery secret in plain text
nor should they reveal the current password.

The product does not require that users should have strong passwords,
which makes it easier for attackers to compromise user accounts.

The software contains a mechanism for users to recover or change their
passwords without knowing the original password,
but the mechanism is weak.
