## Requirement

The system must force the change of temporary passwords,
which are generated by a third party,
after their first use.

## Description

Temporary passwords are often harder to remember and shared over systems whose
future integrity may not be guaranteed by the system that created them.
Furthermore, there is no control over who has access
to the secret besides the third party.
Therefore, the passwords should be changed after their first use.

securely randomly generated, SHOULD be at least 6 characters long,
and MAY contain letters and numbers,

These initial secrets must not be permitted to become the long term password.
