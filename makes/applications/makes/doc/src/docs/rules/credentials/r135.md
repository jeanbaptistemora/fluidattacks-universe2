## Requirement

*Salt* values in passwords
must be random and have a minimum length of *48* *bits*.

## Findings

- [F020. Non-encrypted confidential information](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/020/)

- [F051. Cracked weak credentials](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/051/)

- [CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/759.html)
The software uses a one-way cryptographic hash against an input that should not
be reversible, such as a password,
but the software does not also use a salt as part of the input.

- [CWE-760: Use of a One-Way Hash with a Predictable Salt:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/760.html.)
The software uses a one-way cryptographic hash against an input that should not
be reversible, such as a password,
but the software uses a predictable salt as part of the input.

- [CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/916.html)
The software generates a hash for a password,
but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational
effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

- [NIST 800-63B 5.1.1.2 Memorized Secret Verifiers:](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html)
The salt SHALL be at least 32 bits in length and be chosen arbitrarily so as to
minimize salt value collisions among stored hashes.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V2.4 Credential Storage Requirements.(2.4.1):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify that passwords are stored in a form that is resistant to offline
attacks.
Passwords SHALL be salted and hashed using an approved one-way key derivation
or password hashing function.
Key derivation and password hashing functions take a password, a salt,
and a cost factor as inputs when generating a password hash.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V2.4 Credential Storage Requirements.(2.4.2):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify that the salt is at least 32 bits in length and be chosen arbitrarily
to minimize salt value collisions among stored hashes.
For each credential, a unique salt value and the resulting hash SHALL be
stored.
