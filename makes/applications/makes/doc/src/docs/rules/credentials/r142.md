## Requirement

The organization must modify
all default access credentials of embedded systems.

## Description

Organizations usually keep default configurations of third-party products,
since these may adapt to most environments where they are installed
and facilitate the deployment to production.
However, this practice may leave a default open gate for products
and, in most cases, credentials within provider documentation,
which can be easily found on the Internet.
For this reason it is important to check all configurations
before deployment and remove all default credentials.

## Implementation

1. Remove all default credentials.

2. Implement a mechanism to ensure only users
with administrator privileges can access
product consoles.

3. Create a robust credential policy
to improve the security of all credentials in the organization.

4. The passwords must be changed every so often
in case they are compromised.

5. Perform audits periodically
to detect improper configurations or missing patches.


## Attacks

1. Brute force attack.
2. Information leakage: Technical.

## Attributes

1. Layer: Business layer
2. Asset: Access credentials
3. Scope: Confidentiality
4. Phase: Deployment
5. Type of control: Recommendation

authorized actions under the guise of an authenticated user or service.

Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users' identities
temporarily or permanently.
