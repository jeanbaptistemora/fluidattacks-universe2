## Requirement

Temporary passwords for first system login
must have a maximum lifespan of *120* minutes.

## Description

Temporary passwords are often harder to remember and shared over systems whose
future integrity may not be guaranteed by the system that created them.
Therefore, the system must discard them or make them unusable after *120*
minutes.

Allowing password aging to occur unchecked can result in the possibility of
diminished password integrity.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V2.3 Authenticator Lifecycle Requirements.(2.3.1):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify system generated initial passwords or activation codes SHOULD be
securely randomly generated, SHOULD be at least 6 characters long,
and MAY contain letters and numbers,
and expire after a short period of time.
These initial secrets must not be permitted to become the long term password.
