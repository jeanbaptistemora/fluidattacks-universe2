## Requirement

Passwords must be hashed before being stored using secure hash algorithms such
as *PBKDF2* and *bcrypt*.

## Description

A hash function maps data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values.
It conceals sensitive information as it is often not possible to reverse
hashed texts.
Hashing passwords helps prevent unauthorized actors that may have accessed the
storage system from obtaining them.

The software generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

allow, typically at least 100,000 iterations.
