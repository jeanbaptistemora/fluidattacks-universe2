## Requirement

One-time passwords must be at least 6 characters long.

## Description

One-time passwords (*OTP*) are secrets used during operations that need added
security or as part of user enrollment processes.
Despite their short lifespan, they should have a minimum length of 6 characters
as a protection against brute force attacks.
