## References

- [CWE-620: Unverified Password Change:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/620.html)
When setting a new password for a user,
the product does not require knowledge of the original password,
or using another form of authentication.

- [CWE-640: Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/640.html)
The software contains a mechanism for users to recover or change their
passwords without knowing the original password,
but the mechanism is weak.

- [OWASP Top 10 A2:2017-Broken Authentication:](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A2-Broken_Authentication)
Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users' identities
temporarily or permanently.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V1.4 Access Control Architectural Requirements.(1.4.1):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify that trusted enforcement points such as at access control gateways,
servers, and serverless functions enforce access controls.
Never enforce access controls on the client.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V2.5 Credential Recovery Requirements.(2.5.6):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify forgotten password, and other recovery paths use a secure recovery
mechanism,
such as *TOTP* or other soft token, mobile push, or another offline recovery
mechanism.
