## Requirement

The system must establish a mechanism which can be used to demonstrate
that users have granted their consent to collection of their data.

## Description

Systems usually request information from their users or collect it based
on their interactions with the application.
Regulations demand that none of these collections occur without the user's
consent and that this consent be demonstrable afterwards.
Therefore, the system must have a mechanism
that can be used to demonstrate the grant of the consent.
