## Requirement

System responses to authentication failures
must not indicate which part of the authentication was incorrect.

## Description

Authentication forms are one of the most publicly accessible parts of an
application,
which makes them more susceptible to be attacked.
Most authentication mechanisms require only a username and a password.
If the responses to authentication attempts indicate which authentication
parameter was incorrect,
attackers may be able to obtain a list of valid usernames (user enumeration)
that they can use in brute force attacks.

- [CWE-203: Observable Differences in Behavior to Error Inputs:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/203.html)
Differences in device behavior to an error input may be used by an attacker to
gather security-relevant information about the device.
The information may be as simple as whether a particular operation was
successful.

The product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that
reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the
intended control sphere.

Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users' identities
temporarily or permanently.
