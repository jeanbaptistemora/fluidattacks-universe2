## Requirement

The system must check new passwords
against a list of 1000 to 10000 breached passwords.

## Description

There are various mechanisms for cracking passwords
that use public lists containing breached credentials.
Systems must check submitted passwords against some of these lists and prevent
account creation and password update operations that use passwords contained in
them.

## References

- [CAPEC-16: Dictionary-based Password Attack:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/16.html)
An attacker tries each of the words in a dictionary as passwords to gain access
to the system via some user's account.
If the password chosen by the user was a word within the dictionary,
this attack will be successful (in the absence of other mitigations).

- [CAPEC-560: Use of Known Domain Credentials:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/560.html)
An adversary guesses or obtains (i.e., steals or purchases) legitimate
credentials (e.g., userID/password) to achieve authentication and to perform
authorized actions under the guise of an authenticated user or service.

- [CWE-521: Weak Password Requirements:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/521.html)
The product does not require that users should have strong passwords,
which makes it easier for attackers to compromise user accounts.

Verifiers SHALL compare the prospective secrets against a list that contains
values known to be commonly-used, expected, or compromised.

Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users' identities
temporarily or permanently.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V2.1 Password Security Requirements.(2.1.7):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify that passwords submitted during account registration, login, and
password change are checked against a set of breached passwords either locally
or using an external API.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V2.2 General Authenticator Requirements.(2.2.1):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify that anti-automation controls are effective at mitigating breached
credential testing, brute force, and account lockout attacks.
Such controls include blocking the most common breached passwords,
soft lockouts, rate limiting, CAPTCHA, ever increasing delays between attempts,
IP address restrictions,
or risk-based restrictions such as location, first login on a device,
recent attempts to unlock the account, or similar.
Verify that no more than 100 failed attempts per hour is possible on a single
account.

broken authentication and session management.
