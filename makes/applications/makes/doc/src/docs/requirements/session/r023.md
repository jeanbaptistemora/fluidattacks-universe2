## Requirement

The system must terminate a session if there is a period of inactivity
on the user side of *5* minutes or more.

## Description

A system can leave a session indefinitely active if it does not have an
automatic termination mechanism based on timeout
and the user does not close it manually.

Failure to control timeouts may allow an attacker
to take advantage of unattended sessions and execute actions
on behalf of the authenticated user without their authorization.
This risk can notably increase its criticality if this is also the behavior of
high-privileged administrator accounts,
since it would affect the integrity, confidentiality and availability of the
system, its users and the information it contains.

## Implementation

Set a session timeout: Depending on the business needs and/or the
company's session management policies,
a timeout must be set
for unattended or idle sessions (*5* minutes recommended).

## Attacks

1. An employee or anonymous user takes control of an unattended device with an
active session without the user's authorization.

2. In a web server, having several open sessions during a long period
forces the server to allocate a considerable amount of memory for session
objects.

## Attributes

1. Layer: Resource layer
2. Asset: Session management
3. Scope: Adherence
4. Phase: Operation
5. Type of control: Procedure
