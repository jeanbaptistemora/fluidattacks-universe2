As time passes and your project changes, it becomes necessary to have an efficient way
of knowing how has a type of vulnerability evolved over time. This can be visualized

The information that can be seen here will be divided in cycles based on the date
of the change and the type of change that occured. Here you will be able to
visualize the amount of vulnerabilities that were opened/closed in a specific date
and also the treatment that a set amount of vulnerabilities were given in a
specific date, mentioning its justification and treatment manager.
