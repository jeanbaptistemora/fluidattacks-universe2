The DevSecOps Agent is constituted as an essential element for the implementation of
DevSecOps in projects. It verifies the status of your vulnerabilities and breaks the
build to force the remediation of open and unaccepted vulnerabilities. The agent can be
included in CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) environments as a
security gate. Thus, any changes to the [ToE](/web/glossary/#toe "Target of Evaluation")
can be continuously tested against the closing of confirmed vulnerabilities.
