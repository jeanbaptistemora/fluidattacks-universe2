In this section of the type of vulnerability we can check many characteristics about it
that give us a very good understanding about what the vulnerability does and what kind
of risks come with it. These characteristics are the following:

### Finding Type
This characteristics can be one of two types. First there is the
**Security** vulnerability, that refers to the ones that are a direct and inminent threat
to the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the system. And then there is the
**Hygiene** vulnerability, that refers to the ones that are threats only indirectly but that
given enough time can give way to security vulnerabilities to appear.

### Hacker
This field is filled automatically with the Fluid Attacks e-mail address of the
analyst that created the type of vulnerability.

### Title
This is the name you defined when creating the draft, the list of such names
can be seen in the
[standardization sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L37WnF6enoC8Ws8vs9sr0G29qBLwbe-3ztbuopu1nvc/).
Moreover, in case you need to be more specific about what this type of vulnerability does,
or what it can affect, you may add a brief identifier at the end of the title referring
to it.

### Description
A brief explanation about the vulnerability, specifying how it is
implemented and what kind of threats come with it. This may be filled out automatically
with the description given in the standardization sheet, however, in case the generic
description does not properly capture the situation in which the vulnerability was found,
you may change this description to address this.

### Requirements
Here are specified all the requirements that the vulnerability breaks. These
requirements are defined by us taking into account many international security standards. You can
check them out in this [link](/requirements/).

### Impacts
This is a list of actions that become possible for an attacker as a consequence
of the vulnerability. As they are actions, each list must begin with a verb.

### Affected systems
This is the name that the group administrator gives to the project
or the application that contains the vulnerability.

### Threat
Here we specify who is the attacker and what situation do they need in order
to exploit this vulnerability. For example, the attacker is an unauthorized internet user
with a valid session token for the target application.

### Weakness
This is the related [Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/index.html)
according to MITRE.

### Recommendation
Here we can add a generalized suggestion aimed to the client that would
help them solve the vulnerability.

### Compromised attributes
These are the types of information that were exposed to us
as a consequence of the exploitation of the vulnerability. Such as usernames, passwords,
credit cards, etc.

### Compromised records
This is the number of such type of information that was exposed.

### Sorts
You can specify here with a Yes or a No if you used the Fluid Attacks product
called Sorts as a guide to discover this vulnerability.
