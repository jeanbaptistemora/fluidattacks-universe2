When you determine that a particular group isn't necessary anymore, you can proceed
to delete it. You may also want to only remove your user from the ones that have
access to a particular group. In order to do both of these, first you need to go to
the **Scope** section of the group you want to manage.

### Deleting a group

When you get to the **Scope** section, scroll all the way down until you see the part
called **Delete this group** that has a button with the same name. Be aware that this
section will only appear if you have the appropiate authorization.

![Unsubscribe and Delete Section](/img/web/groups/deletion/delete_unsubscribe.png)

After clicking on this button a window will appear in which you will need to type
the name of the group you are currently managing. Before this, make sure
that you want to proceed with the deletion of the group, as there is no going back
after you complete it. With this consideration in mind, after typing the name of
the group, click on proceed to complete the deletion of the group.

### Unsubscribing from a group

As you may have noticed, above the **Delete this group** section you can find the
**Unsubscribe** section. This function is used only to remove your own user from
the group and thus will not affect anything related to the group and its data at
all. It will only remove this group from the list of groups available to you,
and consequently, revoke your access to it completely.

![Unsubscribe Modal](/img/web/groups/deletion/unsubscribe_modal.png)

By clicking on **Unsubscribe** a window will appear in which you need to follow
the same steps for deleting a group, which is typing the name of the group and
clicking on proceed. Once again, consider carefully when proceeding as this
action will remove you from this group, and in case you do not have any more
groups besides this one, you will be removed from Integrates entirely.
