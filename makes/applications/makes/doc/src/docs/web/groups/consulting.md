The consulting tab is where you can talk directly to us and communicate all the
questions, requests, suggestions and such matters concerning your group or a
specific vulnerability that require much more direct interaction.

In order to manage the many issues that can occur in a group, there are three
locations where you can post comments about specific situations for us to help
you. First, you can do it in the main page of any group, when you open a group
you can see that one of the tabs is called **Consulting**.

![Group Consulting](/img/consulting_ongroup.png)

In this section you can talk to us to assist you with any issues or questions
that you may have about the group in general.

You can also find a comments section inside all of the different vulnerabilities
that are reported in your group. When you click on a vulnerability, you can find
the tab to the right of your screen.

![Vulnerability Consulting](/img/consulting_onvuln.png)

This section will be used to communicate with us when there are any issues
concerning any of the vulnerabilities that are reported in that category or in
case you have questions about that type of vulnerability in general. Furthermore,
in this section you will find comments referencing your requests for **Reattacks**
when you consider one or more vulnerabilities solved and our results corresponding
to such Reattacks.

Finally, you will also find a comments section inside every event listed in the
**Events** tab inside every group. When you click on an event this comments tab
will be available.

This tab will be useful for when you want to ask us the specifics of the event
and also when you consider the event has been solved and wish to notify us
about this.
