The analytics section of your organization contains many graphs related to
the state of all the groups that belong to it. Here you will be able to ascertain
at a glance many aspects of how secure is your organization.

### Vulnerabilities over time

In Integrates, you can track the evolution of your systems from a security
point of view:

- Open vulnerabilities represent a risk currently impacting your end-users
and systems.
- Open vulnerabilities with accepted treatment are exactly like open ones,
except that you decided to coexist with that risk.
- Closed vulnerabilities may be seen as security breaches that your system no
longer has.

### Vulnerabilities status

Ratio between open and closed vulnerabilities, ignoring treatments.

### Vulnerabilities treatment

In Integrates, you can plan and manage the remediation of security findings:

- Not defined: New vulnerabilities go here until one of your managers generates
an action plan.
- In progress: The system is currently being hardened by your developers.
- Temporarily accepted: A manager decided to coexist with the risk temporarily.
- Eternally accepted: A vulnerability that will never be remediated.

### Total findings

A finding is a group of vulnerabilities on your system related to the same
attack vector.

### Total vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities are the minimum units of risk. They are tied to a system,
and a specific location within that system.

### Vulnerabilities with not-defined treatment

Number of vulnerabilities without a remediation plan specified by one of your managers.
