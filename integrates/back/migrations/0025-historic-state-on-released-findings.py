# Formerly a draft was identified by 'not having a releaseDate' in the DB.
# This was migrated and a new column called 'historic_state' was added.
# When this was done there was a missing migration, and now you can find
# Findings with historic state like this:
#
#   "historic_state": [
#     {
#       "date": "2019-10-16 16:50:02",
#       "state": "SUBMITTED"
#     },
#     {
#       "analyst": "xxxxxxxxxx@fluidattacks.com",
#       "date": "2019-10-17 17:37:13",
#       "state": "REJECTED"
#     }
#   ]
#
# And with 'releaseDate', this means a finding that the customer can see
# But which for practical purposes is still a Draft (was never submitted nor
# approved)
#
#
# Discovered around: 2019-11-27
# Fixed in DB around: 2020-08-26 18:43:31+00:00
