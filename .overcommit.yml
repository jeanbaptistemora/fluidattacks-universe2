# Default configuration that all Overcommit configurations inherit from.
#
# This is an opinionated list of which hooks are valuable to run and what their
# out-of-the-box settings should be.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Loads Bundler context from a Gemfile. If false, does nothing (default).
#
# Specifying a Gemfile for Bundler to load allows you to control which gems are
# available in the load path (i.e. loadable via `require`) within your hook
# runs. Note that having a Gemfile requires you to include `overcommit` itself
# in your Gemfile (otherwise Overcommit can't load itself!).
#
# This is useful if you want to:
#
#   - Enforce a specific version of Overcommit to use for all hook runs
#     (or to use a version from the master branch that has not
# been released yet)
#   - Enforce a specific version or unreleased branch
# is used for a gem you want
#     to use in your git hooks
#
# WARNING: This makes your hook runs slower, but you can work around this!
#
# Loading a Bundler context necessarily adds a startup delay to your hook runs
# as Bundler parses the Gemfile and checks that the dependencies are satisfied.
# Thus for projects with many gems this can introduce a noticeable delay.
#
# The recommended workaround is to create a separate Gemfile
# in the root of your
# repository (call it `.overcommit_gems.rb`), and include only the gems that
# your Overcommit hooks need in order to run. This significantly reduces the
# startup delay in your hook runs. Make sure to commit both
# `.overcommit_gems.rb` and the resulting `.overcommit_gems.rb.lock` file to
# your repository, and then set the `gemfile` option below to the name you gave
# the file.
# (Generate lock file by running `bundle install
#  --gemfile=.overcommit_gems.rb`)

# '%{processors} / 2'.

# Whether to check if a hook plugin has changed since Overcommit last ran it.
