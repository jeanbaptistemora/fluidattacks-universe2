## Rationale

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
is used for writing our entire
[infrastructure stack as code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code).

The main reasons why we chose it
over other alternatives are:

1. It is [Open source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source).
1. It is Widely used by the community.
1. It Uses [HCL](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl),
    a very easy to learn structured configuration language.
1. It is not platform-bounded.
1. It has a stateless approach to infrastructure.
    There are no master machines, agents,
    or incremental infrastructure. Instead, infrastructure
    is regenerated from scratch every time it is required.
1. Due to its stateless approach,
    parity between development and production environments
    is assured.
1. It has hundreds of open source
    [providers](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers)
    that give it full flexibility accross many platforms.
1. It has thousands of open source
    [modules](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/modules)
    that simplify writing infrastructure and avoiding repetition.
1. Deploying infrastructure
    usually takes no longer than a few minutes.

## Alternatives

The following alternatives were considered
but not chosen for the following reasons:

1. [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/):
    Deployments were too slow.
1. [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/):
    It is platform-bounded.
1. [AWS Cloudformation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/):
    It is platform-bounded.
1. [Chef](https://www.chef.io/):
    It has a stateful approach to infastructure, including
    a master machine, agents and mutable infrastructure.
1. [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/):
    It is not as widely used,
    resulting in less
    [providers](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/cloud-providers/),
    [modules](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=pulumi&page=0&perPage=20)
    and overall community support.
1. [Puppet](https://puppet.com/):
    It has a stateful approach to infastructure, including
    a master machine, agents and mutable infrastructure.
1. [SaltStack](https://saltproject.io/):
    It has a stateful approach to infastructure, including
    a master machine, agents and mutable infrastructure.

## Usage

Used for every infrastructure piece
like databases, DNS records, firewall rules,
computing clusters, among others.
Some examples are:

1. [Gitlab Runners](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/product/-/tree/2a1e5fc66bcf675fd4249cdf3faf31d3a414a85d/makes/applications/makes/ci/src/terraform).
1. [DNS](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/product/-/tree/2a1e5fc66bcf675fd4249cdf3faf31d3a414a85d/makes/applications/makes/dns/src/terraform).
1. [Kubernetes](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/product/-/tree/2a1e5fc66bcf675fd4249cdf3faf31d3a414a85d/makes/applications/makes/k8s/src/terraform).
1. [Okta](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/product/-/tree/2a1e5fc66bcf675fd4249cdf3faf31d3a414a85d/makes/applications/makes/okta/src/terraform).
1. [Website](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/product/-/tree/2a1e5fc66bcf675fd4249cdf3faf31d3a414a85d/airs/deploy/production/terraform).

We do not use [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) in:

1. [AWS Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/):
    Pending to implement.
1. [Gitlab](/development/stack/gitlab):
    Pending to implement.
1. [Gitlab Runner Bastion](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/autoscale.html):
    Pending to implement.
1. [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/):
    Pending to implement.
1. [Local AWS Redis](https://aws.amazon.com/redis/):
    We use [local Redis clusters](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial)
    as it is not possible to locally deploy Redis clusters using
    [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).
    This implementation is written as code.
1. [Local AWS s3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/):
    We use [MinIO](https://min.io/)
    as it is not possible to locally deploy s3 buckets using
    [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).
    This implementation is written as code.

## Guidelines

1. Test an infrastructure module with `./m <product>.<module>.test`
1. Deploy an infrastructure module with `./m <product>.<module>.apply`
