## Rationale

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
is the system we use
for hosting, deploying and managing
our applications.
It comprises infrastructure solutions like
[RBAC Authorization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/),
[distributed persistent storage](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/),
[managing resource quotas](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/),
[managing DNS records](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns),
[managing load balancers](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller),
[autoscaling](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler),
[blue-Green deployments](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-blue-green-deployment),
[rollbacks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#rolling-back-a-deployment)
among many others.
It allows us to serve and scale our applications
in an easy, secure and automated way.

The main reasons why we chose
it over other alternatives are:

1. It is capable of deploying complex applications,
including related
[Servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)),
[DNS records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System),
and [load balancers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing))
in an automated way,
allowing us to focus
more on the application development
and less on the infrastrucutre supporting it.
1. It can be
[fully managed](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/product/-/blob/ba230133febd3325d0f5c995f638a176b89d32a2/makes/applications/makes/k8s/src/terraform/cluster.tf)
using [Terraform](/development/stack/terraform).
1. It supports
[Blue-Green deployments](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-blue-green-deployment),
allowing us to deploy applications
many times a day
without service interruptions.
1. It supports
[Rollbacks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#rolling-back-a-deployment),
allowing us to revert applications
to previous versions
in case the need arise.
1. It supports
[Horizontal autoscaling](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler),
allowing us to easily adapt our applications
to the loads they're getting.
1. It supports
[Service accounts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/),
[RBAC Authorization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/),
and [IRSA](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/introducing-fine-grained-iam-roles-service-accounts/),
allowing to give applications
permissions to external resources
using a
[least privilege](/criteria/requirements/186)
approach.
1. It supports
[resource quotas](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/),
allowing to easily distribute containers among physical machines using
a granular `cpu/memory per container` approach.
1. It has its own [package manager](https://helm.sh/),
which makes deploying services
[very easy](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/product/-/blob/ba230133febd3325d0f5c995f638a176b89d32a2/makes/applications/makes/k8s/src/terraform/new-relic.tf#L5).
1. It has its own
[local reproducibility](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/)
tool for simulating clusters
in local environments.
1. It is [Open source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source).
1. It is not platform-bounded.
1. [Azure AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/),
[AWS EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks),
[GCP GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine),
support it.
1. It can be [IaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_a_service)
when implemented under a
[cloud provider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing).
1. Migrating it from one
[cloud provider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing)
to another is,
although not a simple task, at least possible.
1. It is
[widely used by the community](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2020/6/kubernetes-statistics-2020).
1. It has many
[open source extensions](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs).

## Alternatives

The following alternatives were considered
but not chosen for the following reasons:

1. [AWS ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html):
It is a serverless service
for running containers.
It is expensive as only one container
exists within an entire physical machine.
It does not support extensions.
It is platform-bounded.
It is not [Open source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source).
1. [AWS Fargate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/userguide/what-is-fargate.html):
It is a serverless service
for running containers
without administering the infrastructure
they run upon.
It is expensive as only one container
exists within an entire physical machine.
It does not support extensions.
It is platform-bounded.
It is not [Open source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source).
1. [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/):
It is a service for cloud computing.
[AWS EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks)
actually uses it for setting up cluster workers.
It does not support extensions.
It is platform-bounded.
It is not [Open source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source).
1. [HashiCorp Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/):
Currently, no
[cloud provider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing)
supports it,
which means that having to manage
both managers and workers is required.
It takes a simpler approach
to orchestrating applications,
with the downside of losing flexibility.
1. [Docker Swarm](https://www.sumologic.com/glossary/docker-swarm/):
Currently, no
[cloud provider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing)
supports it,
which means that having to manage
both managers and workers is required.
It takes a simpler approach
to orchestrating applications,
with the downside of losing flexibility.

## Usage

We use [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) for:

1. [Hosting](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/product/-/tree/ba230133febd3325d0f5c995f638a176b89d32a2/makes/applications/integrates/back/deploy/prod/k8s)
our
[ASM](https://fluidattacks.com/categories/asm/).
1. [Automatically](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/product/-/blob/ba230133febd3325d0f5c995f638a176b89d32a2/makes/applications/integrates/back/deploy/dev/entrypoint.sh)
deploying
[ephemeral environments](/about/security/integrity/developing-integrity#ephemeral-environments)
on
[CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/introduction/)
workflows.
1. Running application performance monitoring using [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/).

We do not use [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) for:

1. [Metrics-based autoscaling](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale-walkthrough/):
Our autoscaling is based on the
[number of replicas](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/product/-/blob/9581d53dc73e59cc7709981743ddc47153d7909a/makes/applications/integrates/back/deploy/prod/k8s/deployment.yaml#L7)
we specify.
It should instead be based
on application load.
1. [Rollbacks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#rolling-back-a-deployment):
We should version production artifacts
in order to be able to automatically
return to a previous working version
of our applications.
1. [Gitlab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/kubernetes.html):
It was slow,
unreliable
and added too much overhead to workers.
We decided to go back to
[Autoscaling Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/runner_autoscale_aws/).
1. [Chaos Engineering](https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/):
In order to harden ourselves against errors,
we should create a little chaos in our infrastructure.

## Guidelines

### Connect to cluster

In order to connect
to the Kubernetes Cluster,
you must:

1. Login as an Integrates developer
using [this guide](/development/stack/aws#get-development-keys).
1. Install kubectl with `nix-env -i kubectl`.
1. Select cluster by running
`aws eks update-kubeconfig --name makes-k8s --region us-east-1`.
1. Run `kubectl get node`.

Your input should be similar to this:

```
$ kubectl get node
