## Syntax

Valid commit messages
have the structure:

```markup
[product]\[type]([scope]): #[issue-number] [title] // This is the commit title
               // This blank line separates the commit title from the commit body
[body]         // This is the commit body. It CAN have multiple lines
```

- **[variable]** are **required** variables
  that must be replaced
  in a final commit message
  (**[]** symbols must be removed)
- **// Comment** are comments
  that must be removed
  in a final commit message

## Rules

The following rules must be met
for a commit message to be valid,
the **product** rule only required
for the integrates repository:

1. **[type]** variable has to be
   one of the following:

   ```markup
   rever  // Revert to a previous commit in history
   feat   // New feature
   perf   // Improves performance
   fix    // Bug fix
   refac  // Neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
   test   // Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
   style  // Do not affect the meaning of the code (formatting, etc)
   sol    // Hacking solution only for writepus and training repo
   ```

1. **[scope]** variable has to be
   one of the following:

   ```markup
   front  // Front-End change
   back   // Back-End change
   infra  // Infrastructure change
   conf   // Configuration files change
   build  // Build system, CI, compilers, etc (scons, webpack...)
   job    // asynchronous or schedule tasks (backups, maintenance...)
   cross  // Mix of two or more scopes
   doc    // Documentation only changes
   vbd    // Vulnerable by design hacking solution only for writeups repo
   code   // Programming challenge solution only for training repo
   hack   // ctf-hacking challenge solution only for training repo
   ```

1. **[product]** variable has to be
   one of the following:

   ```markup
   forces // Changes in forces
   integrates // Changes in Integrates
   all // Changes that affect both integrates and forces
   ```

   must **not** contain
   the '**:**' character.

   it must reference
   issue **#0**.

1. A **blank line**
   between commit title
   and commit body

### Possible combinations

## Recommendations

- Try to itemize your commit body:

  ```text
  - Add feature X in file Y
  - Run script Z
  - Remove file A with B purpose
  ```

## Example

Here is an example
of a compliant commit message:

```markup
integrates\feat(build): #13 add type_check

- Add type_check function
- Remove unnecessary print_output function
```
