## Rationale

[OpenSearch][opensearch] is an open-source search engine forked from
[ElasticSearch][elasticsearch] that came as a response to some
[licensing issues][issues] they had with Elastic, the original developers.

It is maintained by AWS and a community of developers and enables indexing and
full-text search with a flexible API.
