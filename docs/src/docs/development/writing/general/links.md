* **WG65:** We *must* check that each hyperlink,
  apart from leading to a working site,
  always leads to the right place.

* **WG66:** We *must not* use hyperlinks
  that direct the reader to websites or documents<a name="r1"></a>
  written in a language other than English
  unless strictly necessary.

* **WG67:** We *must* put hyperlinks to our services and solutions
  the first and the last time we mention them
  within a subsection, page or blog post.

* **WG68:** We *must* use internal links in the subsections and pages
  whenever we direct the reader to
  (a) another part of them or to
  (b) other subsections or pages.

* **WG69:** We *must* include the reference with hyperlink
  immediately before or after an external source fragment of text is used
  (e.g., [As Alan Turing said](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/alan_turing_164574),
  "Science is a differential (...)").
  It can also be just the link
  associated with some initial words of the textual quotation
  when we do not wish to mention the source within our text
  for reasons of repetition or space.

* **WG70:** We *must* maintain consistency
  in the presentation of hyperlinks within a text.
  So, for example, if in a text we use the word *here*
  to direct the reader to websites,
  every time we mention it and have a corresponding link,
  we *must* associate both elements.

* **WG71:** In the same block of text or list,
  we *must not* give the reader the same link
  associated with the same word or group of words
  unless they are so far apart that we cannot see them simultaneously.
  (There may be an exception: see [WG67](#r1).)

* **WG72:** We *must* avoid putting full paths to websites
  (especially with *https://* and several slashes afterward)
  as references in the visible content
  and then associating those same links to them
  (e.g., To learn more, visit the TypeScript documentation page
