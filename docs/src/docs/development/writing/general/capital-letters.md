* **WG11:** We *must* capitalize **(a)** the first word of a sentence,
  **(b)** the pronoun *I*, **(c)** proper nouns
  (i.e., the names of specific people, organizations,
  places and sometimes things),
  **(d)** titles (e.g., professions) preceding names,
  **(e)** the days of the week, holidays and the months of the year,
  **(f)** nationalities and specific languages,
  **(g)** members of social, national, political,
  civic, racial and athletic groups (e.g., Democrats),
  **(h)** periods and events (e.g., Great Depression),
  and **(i)** trademarks.

* **WG12:** We *must* present the names of our solutions and services
  with initial capital letters (e.g., [Continuous Hacking](https://fluidattacks.com/services/continuous-hacking/)).

* **WG13:** We *must* use initial capital letters in section and subsection headings
  ([following APA standards](https://capitalizemytitle.com/style/APA/)),
  and not in internal subheadings.

* **WG14:** We *must not* use sustained capital letters to emphasize a word or phrase,
  nor mix them with bold or italics.

* **WG15:** We *must* capitalize the first letter of a quote
  when it is a complete sentence
  (e.g., (...) [as Cimpanu in The Record says](https://fluidattacks.com/blog/facebook-data-leak/),
  "While the forum is publicly accessible (...)."),
  as opposed to when it is only a sentence fragment
  (e.g., (...) [that's why people say](https://fluidattacks.com/blog/facebook-data-leak/)
  it's "free data" in almost all the sources I checked.).
  When the quote is interrupted,
  we *must not* capitalize the second part
  (e.g., "I did not want to commit this crime," said Mr. Allen,
  "but an internal force compelled me to do it.").
