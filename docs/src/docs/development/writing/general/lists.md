* **WG58:** We *must* use bullets for lists
  that do not communicate a hierarchical order
  and numbers (starting with 1, 2, 3...) otherwise.

* **WG59:** We *must* place periods at the end of list items
  (except for lists that are paragraph divisions)
  when what we are listing are complete sentences
  or [independent clauses](https://www.grammar-monster.com/glossary/independent_clause.htm).

* **WG60:** When we split a paragraph into a list,
  we *must not* put a colon before the first item;
  each line *must* be in a bullet point beginning with a lowercase letter
  and *must* end with a semicolon, except for the last line.
  This one *must* have a period
  (the penultimate line can also end with a comma
  followed by the conjunction *and*).

* **WG61:** We *can* also display lists in paragraphs (without bullets)
  using letters in parentheses
  (e.g., These emails contain information on
  (a) what data was leaked or compromised;
  (b) when the data was...).

* **WG62:** When all the items in a list begin with one or more words
  followed by a colon and more information,
  we *must* emphasize those first words and the colon in bold.

* **WG63:** We *must* avoid that details expressed in the sentences
  previous to the lists
  be repeated in the items of the lists.

* **WG64:** We *must not* put numbers or bullets
  to words or sentences that stand alone within a subsection,
  page or blog post,
  as if they were part of a list.
