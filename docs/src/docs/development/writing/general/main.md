* **WG01:** *All* the information we display in our documentation and website
  *must* be written in the **English language**.

* **WG02:** We *must* be clear, concise and direct in our writing.

* **WG03:** We *must* not copy and publish other people's text
  without referencing its source.
  We *must* be original in our writings.

* **WG04:** We *must* avoid unnecessary repetition of information in our texts.

* **WG05:** We *must* keep the names of our services, solutions and material
  updated in each of our publications.

* **WG06:** We *must* be consistent with the handling of our key terms
  in each of the sections (i.e., within the documentation),
  pages and blog posts
  (e.g., use "reattacks" all the time and not sometimes "re-attacks").

* **WG07:** We *must not* close any block of text of the subsections and pages
  with farewells (it is different in blog posts).

* **WG08:** We *should* seek to present our ideas mainly in the active voice,
  that is, making it clear to the reader
  who is the subject in charge of each action
  (e.g., passive voice:
  "These security standards are implemented in our daily activities."
  Active voice:
  "We implement these security standards in our daily activities.").

* **WG09:** We *must* be careful with the characters
  that generate an effect on the written material (i.e., inline markup)
  and make the necessary changes when we are transferring information
  from AsciiDoc to Markdown or vice versa.

* **WG10:** We *must* take the time, after writing a text,
  to carefully check for spelling mistakes.
  Once published, the next day,
  we can invest some more time in a new and quick revision,
  to make adjustments if necessary.
