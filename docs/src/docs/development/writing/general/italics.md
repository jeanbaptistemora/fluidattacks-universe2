* **WG25:** We *must not* use quotation marks to refer to words in themselves
  without being part of a quotation.
  In such cases, we *must* use italics
  (e.g., The first known use of the word *ocean* in English
  is from the 14th century.).

* **WG26:** We *must* use italics for titles of large works
  such as books, encyclopedias, dictionaries, newspapers, magazines
  (including online versions of the above),
  music albums, movies, paintings, television series,
  plays, operas, sculptures and ballets.
  We *must not* use italics for the names of social media sites,
  blogs and databases.

* **WG27:** We *must* use italics for foreign words and phrases
  (as long as they are not included
  in our English language reference dictionary:
  [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/)).

* **WG28:** We *must* use italics
  when we want to emphasize a word or expression
  that in itself is not a keyword or a key expression in the text
  (e.g., "In my words,
  the paper calls for a shift in how organizations *see* cybersecurity.").

* **WG29:** We *can* italicize terms
  that we expect to be unfamiliar to readers
  the first time they appear in a text.

* **WG30:** We *must not* italicize punctuation marks
  unless they are within what must be italicized
  (e.g., Did you read the book *Outliers: The Story of Success*?).

* **WG31:** We must italicize letters
  that are employed as statistical symbols or algebraic variables
  ([e.g.](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/italics-quotations/italics),
  Cohen's *d*, *SD*, *M*, *t*).
