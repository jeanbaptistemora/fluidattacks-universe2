If you are not part of the `Fluid Attacks` team,
**do not forget** to send with your piece of writing
an image that represents you (preferably, a picture of you).
We would show this image at the end of the blog post,
along with your name.

You need to send the text in *.adoc* and *.pdf*
and the images for the blog post
to fruiz@fluidattacks.com or fzarate@fluidattacks.com.
Our editors will review these files
to determine and let you know
whether or not we will publish your writing on our website.
