Metadata are variables that influence the final rendering of pages
and how search engines index them.
Below, we show a table with the **mandatory** metadata for a blog post:

|Metadata             |Description                                    |
|:--------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
|:page-slug:          |The portion of the link that goes after https://fluidattacks.com/blog/, completing the URL where we can find the new blog post (e.g., code-translate/). It must not exceed **35 characters** and should contain the main words of the post (preferably associated with the title and subtitle), all in lower case and separated by hyphens. In addition, it may have numbers but no spaces, prepositions, conjunctions or connectors, or special characters.|
|:page-date:          |Date of publication of the blog post, following the format YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2021-06-24).|
|:page-category:      |The category to which the new blog post belongs, using lowercase letters (e.g., attacks, philosophy, machine-learning; all here).|
