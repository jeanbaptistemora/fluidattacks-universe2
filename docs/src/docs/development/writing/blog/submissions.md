If you are not part of the `Fluid Attacks` team,
*do not* forget to send with your piece of writing
an image that represents you (preferably, a picture of yourself).
We will include this image at the end of the blog post,
along with your name.

You must send the text in *.adoc* and *.pdf*
and the images for the blog post
to fruiz@fluidattacks.com.
Our editor will review these files
to determine and let you know
whether or not we will publish your writing on our website.

## Terms and conditions

* At `Fluid Attacks`,
  we are impartial when evaluating the submitted posts,
  i.e., we do not take into account
  whether we agree with the author's opinion.
  Instead, we focus on whether
  the document meets the required guidelines described above.

* We reserve the right to accept or reject any document sent to us.

* If we accept and publish a blog post,
  the author retains the copyright to the draft submitted to us.
  However, we at `Fluid Attacks` maintain the right
  to make changes to that draft, if necessary,
  without the author's consent or notification.

* We do not pay for articles accepted for publication
  on [our blog](https://fluidattacks.com/blog/).
