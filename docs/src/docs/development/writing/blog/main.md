* **BM01:** Our target audience is everyone interested in cybersecurity.
  Therefore, we *must* use non-technical English as much as possible.

* **BM02:** We *must* write blog posts
  that have some relation to cybersecurity.
  (We have a list of **recommended topics** [here](https://fluidattacks.com/topics/),
  but we can address many others;
  see [the latest posts](https://fluidattacks.com/blog/)).

* **BM03:** We *must* generate blog posts
  in the markup language [AsciiDoc](https://asciidoc.org/).
  (Please refer to our [format page](https://fluidattacks.com/format/),
  the [AsciiDoc guide](http://asciidoctor.org/docs/AsciiDoc-writers-guide/)
  or a [quick reference](http://asciidoctor.org/docs/AsciiDoc-syntax-quick-reference/)
  for more information.)

## Title and subtitle

* **BT01:** We *should* grab the readers' attention
  with the blog posts' titles,
  making them funny, thought-provoking or exciting.
  We *can*, for example, write a title as a question
  (e.g., "[What's the Perfect Crime?](https://fluidattacks.com/blog/spectre/)")
  or address it directly to the reader
  (e.g., "[I Saw Your Data on the Dark Web](https://fluidattacks.com/blog/dark-web/)"),
  but we *must not* create a generic title
  (e.g., "SQL Injection").

* **BT02:** We *must* write titles that do not exceed **35 characters**.

* **BT03:** In each case,
  we *should* create a subtitle
  that reflects the purpose or central idea of the blog post
  (e.g., "[Get a digest of Internet crime over the last year](https://fluidattacks.com/blog/fbi-2020-report/),"
  "[Confusion with the cloud shared responsibility model](https://fluidattacks.com/blog/shared-responsibility-model/)").

* **BT04:** We *must* write subtitles that do not exceed **55 characters**.
