Metadata are variables that influence the final rendering of pages
and how search engines index them.
Below, we show a table with the **mandatory** metadata for the documentation:

|Metadata             |Description                                    |
|:--------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
|id:          |The portion of text at the end of the URL (after the last forward slash) of the subsection under consideration. For example, *foss* in docs.fluidattacks.com/machine/scanner/plans/foss.|
|title:          |The title of the subsection in hand before its body of text.|
|sidebar_label:      |The name of the subsection (i.e., the title) appearing in the left-side menu.|
|slug:          |The part of the URL of the subsection that goes after docs.fluidattacks.com (e.g., /machine/scanner/plans/foss).|
