The lib_root module of skims searches deterministic vulnerabilities in
code files for the most commonly used development languages in our clients'
stack.

As mentioned in the introduction, for the languages supported by this library
and that are in active development, the following three-step procedure
is used:

1. Parse the code file into a graph object using third-party libraries
1. Optimize the parsed graph to improve execution speed and development
1. Search vulnerabilities in the optimized graph and create report

For developers, the following sections explain in more detail this process and
the algorithms used in this module.

## 1. Code parsing

Parse the code to a graph called the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) using OS
libraries.

For C#, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, the library is
[tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/)

For Dart, the library is
[tree-sitter-dart](https://github.com/UserNobody14/tree-sitter-dart)

These libraries analyze a code file and parse it into a graph by
creating different nodes that represent each declaration of the code. Each
node is identified by a unique ID and other attributes and is connected
to one or several nodes as they relate to one another.

For example, a method declaration node can have several children, such as
the arguments list, the execution block of the method, and any modifiers or
annotations unique to each language.

These graphs are generally very good representations of the code, however,
we have found that the AST graphs have two major problems:

- They usually contain a lot of unnecessary information, such as
  all the nodes for code syntax symbols, such as {}, ;, etc.
  which makes search algorithms computationally more expensive
  and inefficient.

- The node label types change between languages, which makes it harder
  to program the search methods. For example, in java, function invocation nodes
  are identified as `method_invocation`, whereas in JavaScript, they are
  identified as `call_expression`.

In order to solve these deficiencies, the AST graph goes through a
re-parsing in the following step.

## 2. Graph optimization

The AST graph is re-parsed into an optimized graph called the
**syntax graph**.

As mentioned above, the purpose of this step is two-fold:

- Reduce the complexity and size of the parsed code.
- Generate a standard graph, using common terminology to represent coding
  concepts that are similar between languages.

The re-parsing is done by running the AST through a recursive algorithm
and then generating connections between nodes.

These connections or edges, as they are called, are meant to represent
the execution order of the code and are an important tool in order to program
methods that depend on this execution order.

Each step is analyzed in more detail in the following subsections.

### 2.1 Syntax graph

The syntax graph is created by filtering only the relevant
information (nodes) of the AST graph, and converting each node type label
into the relevant concept that it represents.

1. Starting at the root node of the AST, a general function
   (called `generic`) is in charge of dispatching the node
   to a relevant `reader` function, which depends on the language
   and label type of the node.

1. This `reader` function extracts only the relevant
   information needed of the node and its important children.
   All this information is then sent to a function called a
   `builder` which depends only on the type of the node (The concept that it
   represents, e.g. A method declaration) and is common between all languages.

1. The `builder` function, as the name implies, creates the node
   for the syntax graph and adds all of its relevant characteristics
   (such as name, edges, children IDs, etc.)

1. The `builder` function also generates what is called a "fork",
   by calling the initial `generic` function for each of the children nodes.

1. This recursive process runs until all the important nodes of the AST
   graph have been parsed.

After all the nodes have been parsed, the syntax graph goes through another
process that generates the **control flow** connections
between the major declaration nodes.

### 2.2 Syntax CFG

As mentioned before, in order to be able to identify vulnerabilities in code
that depend on several conditions, it is crucial to establish connections
between the nodes of the graph that represent the execution order of the code.

This is why the syntax graph goes through this step, called the syntax CFG,
which stands for control flow graph.

Simply explained, and as the name implies, this step is what generates the CFG
edges of the graph, which connect major nodes that are related to code
execution and scope.

The following procedure is used:

1. As before, a recursive function, called `generic` dispatches each node
   of the graph and, depending on its type, it calls a `dispatcher` function

1. This `dispatcher` function is in charge of adding the edges to the relevant
   nodes that follow in the code execution order. This is done by adding
   a "CFG" label to the edge connecting the nodes.

To best understand this process, run a simple code in the language
of your preference. For example, use the following JS code:

```js
let my_var1 = 2;
let my_var2 = 3;
sum_vars(my_var1, my_var2);
```

Using this snippet, you can see what types of nodes are created
when you declare a variable and invoke a method.

More importantly, from this example you can see how the CFG edges are added
to represent the flow of the code. That is, how the `my_var1` is connected
to `my_var2` and this in turn is finally connected to the `sum_vars`
method invocation.

After that, you can try to add control structures like conditionals,
loops, or switch statements to see how the nodes are connected
by different paths of execution. For example:

```js
let my_var1;
if (some_var == 2){
   my_var1 = 3;
} else {
   my_var1 = 4;
}
let my_var2 = my_var1 + 10;
```

In the previous snippet, the variable `my_var2` can be reached by two different
paths of execution (One when the if condition is true, and another when it is
false). This generates two paths by connecting the `my_var2` node with each
block of the conditional statement.

Before moving on to develop any methods using the syntax graph (Specially
methods that use the symbolic evaluation), it is recommended that you
familiarize yourself with the node types and the concept of the CFG edges,
to see how each part of the code is parsed and be able to debug the
entire process in case any errors arise.

## 3. Vulnerability search

The last step of the process is programming the methods that search for
vulnerabilities in the code, which is generally made by filtering and
searching the syntax graph for vulnerable declarations or invocations.

This last step can be classified according to two basic types
of vulnerabilities.

### 3.1 Direct vulnerabilities

When a vulnerability is a direct consequence of an unsafe object or
function, all the logic is stored in the lib_root module.

This logic uses the syntax graph to filter a certain type of node and
search for the vulnerable name or symbol that identifies the vulnerability.

See the following pseudocode example:

```js
let vuln_var = new danger_object();
```

In this case, the vulnerability can be detected by filtering the syntax graph
and searching for any declarations of the `danger_object`.

Before moving on to the next type of vulnerabilities, it is recommended
that you try to understand and debug one of several methods in lib_root
that only use the syntax graph to search for direct vulnerabilities.

### 3.2 Compound Vulnerabilities

Some vulnerabilities cannot be checked directly by only filtering
a certain dangerous declaration, because they depend on one or several
additional conditions that have to be met simultaneously.

See the following pseudocode example:

```js
let dangerous_var = "danger";

let vuln_method = potential_danger("danger");
let vuln_method1 = potential_danger(dangerous_var);

let safe_method = potential_danger("safe_var");
```

In this case, the method called `potential_danger` is only a vulnerability
when the parameter `danger` is used.

In order for the method to deliver value to the clients, it needs to be able
to distinguish that the third invocation of the method is safe,
and to report both of the first two occurrences of the vulnerability.

This is the purpose of the **symbolic evaluation** algorithm.

#### 3.2.1 Symbolic evaluation

This is a semi-recursive algorithm that follows the following procedure:

1. As with direct vulnerabilities, in the lib_root module,
   the node that could potentially generate the vulnerability is searched
   by filtering the syntax graph.

1. After the potential danger has been found, the node that may generate the
   danger is then filtered (In the example above, it was the parameter of the
   `potential_danger` method invocation)

1. Using this node and the CFG edges of the graph, all the paths in the
   execution order of the code are generated. Each path is simply a list of
   all the nodes that have to be executed for the code to reach the
   analyzed node.

1. The node and its execution paths are sent to the general
   `generic` dispatcher function in the symbolic evaluation module.

1. Depending on the label_type of the node, the `dispatchers` calls a
   `evaluator` function and sends the node and all the arguments of the
   evaluation.

1. Each node type has its own evaluator function that searches and propagates
   the algorithm to other nodes that are somehow related to it.

   For example, the `SymbolLookup` node type evaluator searches in the graph
   for where that symbol is defined or used. If this search finds any nodes,
   the evaluator then propagates the algorithm by calling the `generic`
   function again with each of the found nodes as parameters.

   Another example, a `VariableDeclaration` node type evaluator simply forks
   the algorithm to the `generic` function to the value node of the variable.

1. This process is repeated until it reaches a node type in which the
   `evaluator` has its own specific evaluator condition for the method
   that is being searched.

   Depending on what the vulnerability is, each method can have one or several
   specific `evaluator` conditions, which finally check if the node is
   dangerous according to the vulnerability requirements.

   (In the example above, there would be a specific evaluator for the node type
   "Literal" which would check if the value of the node is equal to "danger")

   If so, this specific `evaluator` functions mark the node as dangerous.

1. The algorithm finishes once all possible paths have been evaluated using this
   same process, and returns two values:

   - A boolean value called danger.
   - A set of string values called the `triggers` (Maybe empty when not needed)

1. If the algorithm returns the boolean value danger as true, the vulnerability
   is marked.

Before moving on to understanding and using the `triggers`, it is
recommended that you understand methods that only use the danger
value to evaluate a vulnerability.

#### 3.2.2 Symbolic evaluation Triggers

Sometimes, a boolean value is not enough to check for a vulnerability,
because it requires several conditions to be met at the same time.

See the following pseudocode example:

```js
let dangerous_var = "danger";

let transformed_val = danger_transformation(dangerous_var);
let vulnerability = potential_danger(transformed_val);

let safe_method = potential_danger(dangerous_var);
```

In this case, the `danger` variable, needs to go through a
`danger_transformation` method before being used in the `potential_danger`
to cause a true vulnerability.

Ensuring this double condition would not be possible only with the use
of a boolean value. This is the main use of the triggers.

The symbolic evaluation works the same way as explained above, only this time,
at the specific evaluator for the method, a value would get added
to the triggers to represent the additional vulnerable condition.

It is recommended that you use the triggers object only when you
fully understand its implications and use cases.
As guidelines, try to debug one of several existing methods that use them.

## 4. Debugging

To see the parsed graphs (Both the AST and the syntax graph),
you can run skims using the --debug flag.

This will generate SVG files in the ~.skims folder in your home directory.
A total of four SVG files are currently generated, the first is the AST and
the last one is the Syntax graph.
(Note: The use and definition of the second and third SVG files is outside
the scope of this documentation because they are in the process of
being deprecated)

You can run the debugger of your code editor or use as many `print`
statements as you need, in order to see how each step is executed.
As mentioned in each step, each `generic` function found in each module is
the origin point of the algorithm, so it is the most helpful to follow.
