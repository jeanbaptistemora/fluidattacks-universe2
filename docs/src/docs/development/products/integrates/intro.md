and its [API](/machine/api).

## Public Oath

1. The ARM is accessible at

1. Changes to the user interface of the ARM
   that are "significant"
   will be announced
   via the appropriate communication mechanism.
1. The API is accessible at
   [app.fluidattacks.com/api](https://app.fluidattacks.com).

   should backward incompatible changes need to be made in the API,
   for example, but not limited to:
   deprecating attributes and entities,
   making optional arguments mandatory,
