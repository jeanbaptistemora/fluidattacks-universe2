## Overview

Integrates' frontend is a web application
built with [React][react] and [TypeScript][ts].

## Browser support

Supported browsers are listed in [requirements](/machine/web/arm#requirements).

Thanks to [TypeScript][ts],
we can use newer ECMAScript language features,
as it already takes care of that when traspiling,
but as for runtime features,
it is important to ensure compatibility.

## Principles

- _Functional_:
  The view should be a function of state and props.
  The codebase only uses functional components,
  avoids direct mutations and favors a declarative style.
- _The state should not exist_:
  Keep state to a minimum.
- _There's a component for that_:
  If there isn't, feel free to create it.
- _No need to reinvent the wheel_:
  Sometimes, third party packages have already figured it out.

## Getting started

To view the changes reflected as you edit the code, you can run:

```bash
  m . /integrates/front
```

## Linting

The frontend uses [ESLint][eslint]
and [Prettier][prettier]
to enforce compliance with a defined coding style.

To view and auto-fix linting issues you can run:

```bash
  m . /integrates/front/lint
```

## Testing

The frontend uses [Jest][jest] as a test runner and
the utilities provided by [React Testing Library][rtl]
to test the UI behavior from a user perspective.

To execute the test cases on your computer, you can run:

```bash
  m . /integrates/front/test
```

## Development workflow

1. Start the development server

   ```bash
   m . /integrates/front
   ```

   The changes will be reflected
   as you edit and save the code.
   If it can't be instantly applied,
   the server will perform a full reload
   on the page you are working.

   You can read more
   about this functionality here:
   https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/

1. Lint your code

   ```bash
   m . /integrates/front/lint
   ```

   You have the option
   to lint in real time (with ESLint)
   and fix on save,
   by following the next steps:

   - Download the
     [VScode eslint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
   - Go to settings.json in vscode
     and add these rules:

     ```json
     {
       // This tells the extension to lookup for node_modules in the front directory.
       "eslint.workingDirectories": ["front"],
       // This allows you to autofix linting errors on save.
       "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
         "source.fixAll": true
       }
     }
     ```

1. Test your code

   ```bash
   m . /integrates/front/test
   ```
