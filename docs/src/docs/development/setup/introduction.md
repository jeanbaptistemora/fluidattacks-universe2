This section will guide you through setting up
a terminal
with AWS credentials
and a code editor
in an automated way
every time you enter
your local checkout
of the Universe repository.

After this section you will be able to develop with:

- code auto-completion,
- go-to-definition functionality,
- required dependencies in the host,
- automatic formatters, etc.
