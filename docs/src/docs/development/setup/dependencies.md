Depending on the product
you are going to develop
you need to setup a few dependencies.
The easiest way to do this is the following:

1. Install [direnv](https://direnv.net/)
1. Run: `$ echo export DIRENV_WARN_TIMEOUT=1h >> ~/.bashrc`
1. Run: `$ cd /path/to/fluidattacks/product`
1. Run: `$ direnv allow` and follow the instructions displayed in your console
