## Technology stack

* *TypeScript:*
a typed superset of JavaScript
that compiles to plain JavaScript.

  To learn more,
  visit the TypeScript documentation page at
  https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html.

* *React Native:*
A framework for building
native apps with React.

  We also use React
  for Integrates web front-end.
  There are some differences
  between ReactJS and React Native,
  but the key ones are:

  - There are no HTML Elements,
  only React Components,
  although there is View,
  which is the closest you can get
  to a normal HTML
  - Since RN doesn't have a DOM concept
  and doesn't produce HTML,
  there is no CSS either.
  Though,
  there is an equivalent known as
  https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/stylesheet.html[StyleSheet]
  - Most ReactJS libraries
  are compatible with React Native,
  actually,
  we can share code between front/ and mobile/
  as long as it doesn't call
  web-specific JS features
  such as `document` or `window`

    To learn more,
    visit the RN documentation page at
    http://facebook.github.io/react-native/.

* **Expo:**
A set of tools,
libraries, and services
that allows us to
build react-native apps faster
in a less bare-metal way. 

  > Expo is kind of like Rails
  for React Native.
  Lots of things are set up for you,
  so it's quicker to get started
  and on the right path.
  With Expo,
  you don't need Xcode
  or Android Studio.
  You just write JavaScript

  Thanks to Expo
  we can make use of several development goodies,
  such as the development server,
  that allows us to run the app
  by scanning a QR code
  and enables live-reloading,
  so it's a matter of editing
  and saving the source file
  to almost instantly see the changes
  reflected in the app.

  Keep in mind
  that our dependencies will fetch react-native
  from Expo's forked repo,
  and that's because RN is at a fast-changing rate,
  so this is in favour
  of a more stable development experience.
  Expo releases SDKs periodically,
  introducing new features,
  bug fixes,
  and the latest additions
  to React and React Native.

  To learn more,
  visit the Expo documentation page at
  https://docs.expo.io/introduction/faq/.

* **Apollo Client:**
A comprehensive state management library
for JavaScript that enables you
to manage both local and remote data
with GraphQL

  To learn more,
  visit the documentation page at
  https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/.

* **Jest:**
A JavaScript testing framework
worked on full-time
by Facebook's JavaScript Foundation team.

  To learn more,
  visit the Jest documentation page at
  https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started.

## Development workflow
1. Start the backend server

  > **NOTE:**
  Due to security policies in android and iOS,
  mobile apps won't trust self-signed HTTPS certs.
  To workaround that limitation
  you must run the backend as HTTP
  using the following command

  ```
  ./m integrates.back dev-mobile
  ```

2. Start the app bundler

  ```
  ./m integrates.mobile
  ```

  Then,
  scan the generated QR code
  with the Expo client App:
  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent

  > **IMPORTANT:**
  Make sure your PC and Smartphone
  are in the same network
  so they can reach each other

  > **NOTE:**
  Due to Apple limitations imposed on Expo,
  iOS users won't see an option
  to scan QR in the client.
  Use the camera app instead

  > **NOTE:**
  Default permissions changed in iOS 14.
  If you are developing on apple devices,
  make sure to allow network access
  for the Expo client
  ![Expo Network Access](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1622211886/docs/development/mobile-technologies/expo_network_access_f4k0se.webp)

3. Lint your code
  ```
  ./m integrates.mobile.lint
  ```

4. Test your code
  ```
  ./m integrates.mobile.test
  ```

5. Review the changes
in the 'ephemeral' environment

  After the pipeline passes,
  you can try out your changes,
  scanning the QR code
  in the following URL:
  https://expo.io/@developmentatfluid/integrates?release-channel=youruseratfluid
