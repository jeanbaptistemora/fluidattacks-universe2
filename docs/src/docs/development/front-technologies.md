## Development workflow

1. Start the development server
```
./build.sh integrates.front
```

The changes will be reflected as you edit and save the code. If it can't be instantly applied, the server will perform a full reload on the page you are working.

You can read more about this functionality here: https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/

> **_NOTE:_**
Google Chrome might cause trouble because of invalid https certificates in localhost. If the bundle fails to load, you can go to chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost and enable that flag

2. Lint your code
```
./make integrates.front.lint
```

You have the option to lint in real time (with ESLint) and fix on save, by following the next steps:

- Download the [VScode eslint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

- Go to settings.json in vscode and add these rules:
```
{
  // This tells the extension to lookup for node_modules in the front directory.
  "eslint.workingDirectories": ["front"],
  // This allows you to autofix linting errors on save.
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll": true
  }
}
```

3. Test your code
```
./make integrates.front.test
```
