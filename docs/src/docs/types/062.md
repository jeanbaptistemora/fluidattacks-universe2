## Description

The application does not validate
the number of active sessions each user has,
thus a user can login
more than once at the same time.
Furthermore,
the application does not notify the user
when a session has already been initiated
nor when a second one commences
from a different location.

## Requirements

- [025. Manage concurrent sessions](/criteria/session/025)
