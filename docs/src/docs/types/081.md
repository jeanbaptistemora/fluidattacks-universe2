## Description

Critical services of the system, such as databases,
shared resources containing sensitive information and web services,
are not protected by a multi-factor authentication mechanism.
This makes it easier for an attacker who has compromised a userâ€™s account
to access those resources.

## Rules

- [229. Request access credentials](/criteria/authentication/229)

- [231. Define a biometric verification component](/criteria/authentication/231)

- [264. Request authentication](/criteria/authentication/264)

- [319. Make authentication options equally secure](/criteria/authentication/319)

- [328. Request MFA for critical systems](/criteria/authentication/328)
