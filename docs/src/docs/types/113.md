## Description

There are variant variables in the source code,
i.e., no specific type is declared for them.
This can be inefficient,
as it becomes necessary
to identify the variableâ€™s data type
and cast it every time it is used.

## Requirements

- [164. Use optimized structures](/criteria/source/164)
