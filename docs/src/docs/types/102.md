## Description

The system performs a partial check on the uniqueness of email addresses,
as it does not properly filter the "**+**" character.
As a result, "**user@exam.com**", "**user+1@exam.com**"
and "**user+100@exam.com**" are considered independent
despite the fact that they all represent the "**user@exam.com**" email account.
This lack of validation could cause two independent accounts
to be linked to the same email address.
