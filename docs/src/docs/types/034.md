## Description

The system uses insecure functions, insufficient ranges or low-entropy
components to generate random numbers.
This could allow an attacker to guess the generation sequence after a short
time or predict results using probabilistic methods.

## Requirements

- [223. Uniform distribution in random numbers](/criteria/cryptography/223)

- [224. Use secure cryptographic mechanisms](/criteria/cryptography/224)
