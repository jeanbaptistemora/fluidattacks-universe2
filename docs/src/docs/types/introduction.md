## Types

The purpose of this page
is to present a set of findings
reported by Fluid Attacks.

**Types** is a standardization
of the set of types of vulnerabilities
that serve as a basis for the security analysis
performed by Fluid Attacks.
This is an ever-evolving effort
as new types arise every day.
