## Description

The application triggers logging events exclusively from the front-end.
This could be used by an attacker to disrupt the traceability
of their actions by dropping the logging requests.

## Requirements

- [075. Record exceptional events in logs](/criteria/logs/075)

- [320. Avoid client-side control enforcement](/criteria/architecture/320)
