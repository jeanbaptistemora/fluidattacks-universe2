## Description

The system does not properly check, on the serverâ€™s side, whether or not the user has enough permissions to modify certain fields, and/or allows them to use invalid data in some fields. This is the basis for several types of injections.

## Requirements

- [173. Discard unsafe inputs](/criteria/source/173)

- [320. Avoid client-side control enforcement](/criteria/architecture/320)

- [342. Validate request parameters](/criteria/source/342)
