## Description

The configuration of the mDNS services
allows an attacker to spoof IP addresses, effectively hijacking them
or causing a denial-of-service.
Alternatively, due to a lack of certain security measures,
it is possible to intercept requests to mDNS services
and obtain information about the connected devices.

## Rules

- [062. Define standard configurations](/criteria/architecture/062)

- [273. Define fixed security suite](/criteria/system/273)
