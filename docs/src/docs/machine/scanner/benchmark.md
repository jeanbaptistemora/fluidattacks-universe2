The [Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)](https://owasp.org/)
is a non-profit foundation
committed to helping improve
software security.
It acts as an open,
online community where anyone
can contribute to the production of material
in the field of web application security
and benefit from the information available.

The [OWASP Benchmark Project](https://owasp.org/www-project-benchmark/)
is a free Java test suite
created in 2015 to assess the accuracy,
speed, and coverage of automated
software vulnerability detection tools.
It helps determine the strengths
and weaknesses of different
application security testing programs
and allows objective comparisons between them.

By running different security testing tools
over the OWASP benchmark
we can put under evaluation different
static ([SAST](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/static-application-security-testing-sast)),
dynamic ([DAST](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/dynamic-application-security-testing-dast)),
and interactive ([IAST](https://www.comparitech.com/net-admin/what-is-iast/))
software vulnerability detection tools.

By comparing the results of different products
offered in the market,
we get an **important indicator
for choosing what tool to include
in our Software Development Lifecycle**.
