When run as part of Fluid Attack's Machine plan or superior
we'll configure everything for you.
The service will constantly monitor the security state of your system,
open new security findings as they are introduced,
and close security findings once they are no longer present in the system.

At all moments you can read awesome reports and analytics at Fluid Attack's App:

- Description of the vulnerability
