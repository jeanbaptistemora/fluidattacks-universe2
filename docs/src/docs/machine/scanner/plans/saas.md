When run as part of
`Fluid Attack's` Machine plan or superior
we'll configure everything for you.
The service will constantly monitor
the security state of your system,
open new security findings
as they are introduced,
and close security findings
once they are no longer present
in the system.

At all moments you can read awesome reports
and analytics at Fluid Attack's App:
