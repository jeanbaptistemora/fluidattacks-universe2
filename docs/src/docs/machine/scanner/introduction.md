Fluid Attacks' scanner is a security vulnerability detection tool.
This means it scans your source-code, infrastructure and applications and reports
to you the security problems they have.

Fluid Attacks' scanner is able to constantly monitor the security state of your system.
It opens new security findings as they are introduced,
and closes security findings once they are no longer present in the system.

At all moments you can read awesome reports and analytics at Fluid Attack's App:

- Description of the vulnerability
