There is a special treatment
that you can give
to any reported vulnerabilities
which is called **zero risk**,
which means that
according to analysis and consideration
taken by your organization,
this vulnerability poses no threat.
In order to make a Zero Risk request
you can take the same steps
taken to assign a normal treatment.

![Request Zero Risk](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1622211885/docs/web/vulnerabilities/management/request_zero_risk_pf9nod.webp)

After choosing to give
a Zero Risk treatment
to the selected vulnerability
you only need to add
a treatment justification,
this information will be used by us
to consider whether the vulnerability
actually poses no threat at all,
in which case
the vulnerability will be deleted,
however,
if we still consider there is a risk,
then it will remain reported.
