The analytics section of your organization
contains many graphs
related to the state of all the groups
that belong to it.
Here you will be able to ascertain at a glance
many aspects of how secure is your organization.

### Vulnerabilities over time

In Integrates,
you can track the evolution of your systems
from a security point of view:

- Open vulnerabilities represent a risk
  currently impacting
  your end-users and systems.
- Open vulnerabilities with accepted treatment
  are exactly like open ones,
  except that you decided
  to coexist with that risk.
- Closed vulnerabilities may be seen
  as security breaches
  that your system no longer has.

### Vulnerabilities status

Ratio between
open and closed vulnerabilities,
ignoring treatments.

### Vulnerabilities treatment

In Integrates,
you can plan and manage
the remediation of security findings:

- Not defined:
  New vulnerabilities go here
  until one of your managers
  generates an action plan.
- In progress:
  The system is currently
  being hardened by your developers.
- Temporarily accepted:
  A manager decided
  to coexist with the risk
  temporarily.
- Eternally accepted:
  A vulnerability
  that will never be remediated.

### Total findings

A finding is a group of vulnerabilities
on your system
related to the same attack vector.

### Total vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities are
the minimum units of risk.
They are tied to a system,
and a specific location
within that system.

### Vulnerabilities with not-defined treatment

Number of vulnerabilities
without a remediation plan
specified by one of your managers.
