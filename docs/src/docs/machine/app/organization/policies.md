In the ASM,
it is possible to set
several policies
for your organization
to help you control
the risks you are willing to take
in your groups
when you decide to
accept vulnerabilities.
You can get to the policies section
by clicking on the **Policies** tab
that you find in the main page
of your organization.

![Policies Section](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1622586635/docs/web/organizations/policies_section_bltci8.png)

The policies you can set are the following:

- The maximum number
  of calendar days
  a finding can be
  temporally accepted,
  this limit can be
  at most 31 calendar days.
- Temporal [CVSS 3.1](/about/glossary/#cvss)
  score range
  between which
  a finding can be accepted,
  which can be a number
  between 0.0 and 10.0,
  in case you choose
  the recomended 0.0,
  no vulnerabilities
  will be able to be
  temporarily accepted.
- Maximum number of times
  a finding can be
  temporally accepted,
  which can be
  anything you consider
  appropiate.
