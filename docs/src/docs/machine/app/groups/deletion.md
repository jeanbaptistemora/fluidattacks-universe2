When you determine that a particular group
isn't necessary anymore,
you can proceed to delete it.
You may also want
to only remove your user
from the ones that have
access to a particular group.
In order to do both of these,
first you need to go
to the **Scope** section
of the group you want to manage.

### Deleting a group

When you get to the **Scope** section,
scroll all the way down
until you see the part called
**Delete this group**
that has a button with the same name.
Be aware that this section
will only appear
if you have the appropiate authorization.

![Unsubscribe and Delete Section](/img/web/groups/deletion/delete_unsubscribe.png)

After clicking on this button
a window will appear
in which you will need to type the name
of the group you are currently managing.
Before this,
make sure that you want to proceed
with the deletion of the group,
as there is no going back
after you complete it.
With this consideration in mind,
after typing the name of the group,
click on proceed
to complete the deletion of the group.

### Unsubscribing from a group

As you may have noticed,
above the **Delete this group** section
you can find the **Unsubscribe** section.
This function is used only to remove
your own user from the group
and thus will not affect anything
related to the group
and its data at all.
It will only remove this group
from the list of groups available to you,
and consequently,
revoke your access to it completely.

![Unsubscribe Modal](/img/web/groups/deletion/unsubscribe_modal.png)

By clicking on **Unsubscribe**
a window will appear
in which you need to follow
the same steps for deleting a group,
which is typing the name of the group
and clicking on proceed.
Once again,
consider carefully when proceeding
as this action will remove you from this group,
and in case you do not have
any more groups besides this one,
you will be removed from Integrates entirely.
