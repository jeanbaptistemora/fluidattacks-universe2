Upon entering
one of your groups
you can access
its **Authors** section
by clicking on the corresponding tab.
When you click on it,
the **ASM** will show you
all of the authors
that have contributed
to the development
of the application
that corresponds to your group.

Depending on the number
of authors
that a group has
the pricing of the **Squad** plan varies,
so as you can see,
**ASM** shows every author
only once,
all the groups
that such author
has contributed in
and a single commit
as an example
of the contributions
they have made.
