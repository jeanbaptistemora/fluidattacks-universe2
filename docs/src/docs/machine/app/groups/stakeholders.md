The stakeholders of a group
are the users
who can access it,
in order to visualize information
or for managing the group's vulnerabilities,
scope, tags, etc.
In order to
add users to your group
and also to edit or remove users
that your group already has,
you can go to the **Stakeholders** tab,
which is one of the tabs
that appear when entering a group.
