While using the ASM
and managing your organization
or groups,
you may come to have questions
about the usage
of the ASM in general.
For answering those questions,
there is a function
that allows you
to chat directly with us,
which you can find
at any moment
while you browse around
the ASM
in the top right corner
of your screen.

![Support Button](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1622669089/docs/web/organizations/support/support_button_highlight_tjivwk.png)

There will be
a **question mark(?)** button
which you can click,
and then this small chat
will appear
in the lower right corner
of your screen.

![Support Chat](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1622669090/docs/web/organizations/support/support_chat_kmc0bu.png)

Use this chat
to convey your questions to us
and we will do our best
to help you as soon as we can.

There is also another option
to receive help from us
and that is by reaching us
through our support email address:

- help@fluidattacks.com

Use this address to send us
any questions you have,
the same as using the chat,
however,
as the communication through email
is much slower than chatting,
we recommend you
to give us as much details
as you can
about the problem
or problems you have,
this way
we won't have to ask you
for such details
that we need to help you
and will be able
to give you an appropiate answer
much faster.
