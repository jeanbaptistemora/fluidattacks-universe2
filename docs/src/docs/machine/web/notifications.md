Notifications are an excellent way
for you to have an up-to-date
understanding of the activity
concerning your system’s vulnerabilities
and your groups on the ASM.
These notifications are sent
directly to your email address.
You are free to customize the
notifications you wish to receive
in the Notifications section on the ASM.
To access this section,
you need to click on the
User information drop-down menu
and choose Notifications.
There,
you will be presented with a matrix
where you can turn on/off different
kinds of email notifications.

The following are the kinds
of notifications we send
from the ASM.

## Types of notifications

### Vulnerability assignment

If you enable these notifications,
you will receive an email when a
vulnerability is assigned to you,
informing you of its location and
the group where it was reported.
At the end of the message,
you will see a button that says
**Go to type of vulnerability**.
When you click on it,
you will be directed to that
type of vulnerability on the ASM.

### Treatment updates

If you enable these notifications,
you will receive an email whenever
new treatments for vulnerabilities
are defined or changes to them
occur within your organization.
This notification will inform you
of the type of vulnerability,
the group where it was reported,
who defined the treatment and
what treatment it is.
At the end of the message,
you will see a button that says
**Go to type of vulnerability**.
When you click on it,

![Inactivity Alert](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1651005444/docs/web/notifications/notif_inactivity_alert.png)

### Access granted

To be a part of a specific
organization or group on the ASM,
a user manager must send you an
invitation and you must confirm it.
When you are invited,
you will get a notification
email with the subject "Access
granted to [group’s name] on
ASM by `Fluid Attacks`."
The message informs
you who invited you,
the group’s name and
its description.
It also provides you with a
link to our [Privacy Policy](https://fluidattacks.com/privacy/),
to which you agree if you
confirm the invitation and,
by so doing,
your access to the ASM.
At the end of the message,
you will find two buttons,
one to **Confirm access** and
the other to **Reject access**.
You will have seven
calendar days to confirm,
after which the invitation
will expire.

### Consulting

If you enable these notifications,
every time someone posts a
comment concerning a group,
a specific vulnerability
or an event,
you will get a **New Comment**
email showing the comment,
who made it and where.
At the end of the message,
you will be presented with
a button that says **Go to comment**,
which will lead you to the
comment on the ASM upon clicking it.

### Root updates (root moved)

Our attack surface management
platform makes it possible to
correct errors such as having
created a root in the wrong group.

### Root updates (root deactivated)

Our attack surface management
platform allows you to deactivate
a root when it does
not exist anymore,
was changed,
or added by mistake.
You can also deactivate
roots for which you no
longer want an assessment.
If you enable
**Root updates** notifications,
you will receive a **Root Deactivated**
email along with the
reason for deactivation,
how long the root was
registered on the ASM and
the closed vulnerabilities
that were found with SAST

## Notifications exclusive to Fluid Attacks staff

### Draft updates (new draft)

When reporting a
vulnerability in a group,
hackers may need to add a
type of vulnerability in

In this scenario,
they must submit a
vulnerability draft.
If you enable
**Draft updates** notifications,
you will receive an email
telling you when a draft
is submitted for revision.

then changes to not-submitted).
The message tells you
who rejected it,
