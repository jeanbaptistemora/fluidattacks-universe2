Notifications are an excellent
way for you to have an up-to-date
understanding of the activity
concerning your system’s
vulnerabilities and your
groups on the ASM.
These notifications are sent
directly to your email address
or mobile phone (via SMS).
You are free to customize the
notifications you wish to receive
in the Notifications section on the ASM.

To access this section,
you need to click on the
[User information drop-down menu](https://fluidattacks.com/privacy/)
and choose then Notifications.
By toggling the on/off button,
you can enable or disable the
delivery of each notification to
your registered email or mobile phone.

The following are the kinds
of notifications we send
from the ASM.

## Types of notifications

### Vulnerability assignment

you will receive an email when a
vulnerability is assigned to you,
informing you of its location and
the group where it was reported.
At the end of the message,
you will see a button that says
**Go to type of vulnerability**.
When you click on it,
you will be directed to that
type of vulnerability on the ASM.

new treatments for vulnerabilities
are defined or changes to them
occur within your organization.

### Access granted

To be a part of a specific
organization or group on the ASM,
a user manager must send you an
invitation and you must confirm it.
When you are invited,
you will get a notification
email with the subject "Access
granted to [group’s name] on
ASM by `Fluid Attacks`."
The message informs
you who invited you,
the group’s name and
its description.
It also provides you with a
link to our [Privacy Policy](https://fluidattacks.com/privacy/),
to which you agree if you
confirm the invitation and,
by so doing,
your access to the ASM.
At the end of the message,
you will find two buttons,
one to **Confirm access** and
the other to **Reject access**.
You will have seven
calendar days to confirm,
after which the invitation
will expire.
