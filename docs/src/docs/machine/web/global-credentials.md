You can store the credentials at
the organization level and use
them in all the groups that make
up the organization.
To see the credentials that exist,
you have to go to the main page
in the tab called credentials.

## Credentials table

Here you can see the list
of all the credentials created
in the organization you are located in.
In total, we have three columns which
are described below:

- **Name:**
  The name of the credential.
- **Type:**
  Which type of credential it is,
  can be [HTTPS](machine/web/groups/scope/roots#adding-a-root-with-the-https)
  or [SSH](machine/web/groups/scope/roots#adding-a-root-with-the-ssh-key).
- **Owner:**
  The person who created the credential.

where you can add new credentials.

Here,
you will have to enter a unique
credential name and select the
credential type (
[HTTPS](/machine/web/groups/scope/roots/#adding-a-root-with-the-https)
or
[SSH](/machine/web/groups/scope/roots/#adding-a-root-with-the-ssh-key)
).

### Edit

To edit an existing credential,
you have to select which
one you want to edit.
A pop-up window will appear,
where you have to click on

to enable editing of the credential
and change its information.

### Remove

To delete a credential,
you have to select which
one you want to delete;
a warning window will appear
asking for your confirmation.

The following are some points to
keep in mind regarding credentials:

- If the credential is removed,
  it is also removed from all
  the git roots used.
- When a stakeholder is removed
  from the organization,
  then their credentials are
  removed from that organization.
- The owner of the credentials
  is the last one that edited
  the credential's secrets.
