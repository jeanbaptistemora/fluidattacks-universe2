In the
**Vulnerabilities** subsection,
you can request vulnerability
reports by clicking on the
**Reports** button that
appears at the top left,
as you can see in the
following screenshot:

The available report options
have either summarized and
easy-to-read information or
complete and technical
information about the
vulnerabilities that have
been reported in a specific group.
When you click on
the Reports button,
you can see the following
options:

![Reports Options](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1650645963/docs/web/groups/reports/reports_options.png)

- **Certificate:**
  This option generates
  a security testing
  certification.
- **Executive:**
  This option creates a
  summarized report in PDF
  of all vulnerabilities
  reported in the group,
  tailored to a management
  perspective.
- **Technical:**
  This option generates a
  much more in-depth report
  in XLSX of all vulnerabilities
  reported in the group,
  or filtered by treatment,
  suitable for those who want
  all the technical details.
- **Export:**
  This option creates a ZIP
  file with an export of all
  vulnerabilities reported
  in the group (includes the
  previous reports and files
  of compromised records
  and evidence).

When you select the
desired report option,
if you have not yet registered
your mobile phone
number in the ASM,
you will see a message
asking you to do so.
You just have to go to the
[user information drop-down menu](/machine/web/user-information)
and select the Mobile option.
A verification code will
be sent via SMS to the
number you provide.
Once you have
registered your number,
in order to obtain
the requested report,
you must enter another
verification code that
will be sent to your mobile,
as you can see below:

![Verification Code](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1650645963/docs/web/groups/reports/reports_verification.png)

As immediately announced
by a message in the ASM,
it will send you an email
with a link to the report
in a couple of minutes.
Once you receive it,
clicking on the
**Go to report** button
will allow you to download
the report to your device.
It is essential to note
that the access granted
through the link is only
available for one hour.
