Sometimes,
a situation may arise for a group
that prevents analysts from pentesting
part of the scope or maybe all of it.
When this is the case,
we need to keep track of these situations
and manage them,
so we can resolve them quickly and efficiently.
This is what the **Event** tab is used for.

### Creating an event

In order to create a new event,
you need to click on the **New** button
that is in the **Event** tab.
Then,
a pop-up will appear for creating the event.

![New Event Modal](/img/web/groups/events/newevent_modal.png)

Here you must enter
all the information about the event
including:

- The approximate date and time
  at which the event was discovered.
- Select the type
  that better summarizes the event.
- The location at which the analyst was
  when the event was discovered.
- Specify if the event affects accesibility
  to the **Environment**,
  **Repository** or both.
- A more detailed description
  about the event.
- The action you were performing
  before being blocked by the event
  and what you would do
  after the block.
- Evidence of the event
  presented in an image or a file.

After the entering the information
and pressing the **Proceed** button,
the ASM will create a new event
and send an email to all project managers.
You can also click on the **Cancel** button
to dismiss the creation of the event.

### Closing an event

When a group user notifies
that the event has been solved
or the analysts find out
that they can now access
the previously blocked targets
with no problems,
then it is time
to close the event.

![Event Solved Button](/img/web/groups/events/markasolved_button_highlight.png)

This can be done by entering the **Event** tab
and clicking on the event that was solved,
then in the description of the event
there will be a button called **Mark as solved**.
When you click it,
a pop-up will appear.

![Event Solved Modal](/img/web/groups/events/markasolved_modal.png)

In here you must specify the date
that the analyst was notified about
or discovered that
the event had been solved,
and also provide the number of hours
that the event affected the group.
With this done
you can click on **Proceed**
to mark the event as solved,
and now it will appear closed
in the event table.
