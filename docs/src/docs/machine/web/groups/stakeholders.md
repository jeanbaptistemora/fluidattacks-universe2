The stakeholders of a group
are the users
who can access it
to visualize information
or manage vulnerabilities,
scope,
tags,
etc.
Only if you have the
[User manager](/machine/web/groups/roles#user-manager-role)
role,
you can add,
edit or remove these users.
To use these functions,
you have to go to the
**Stakeholders** section
in your group.
