When you determine
that a particular group
isn't necessary anymore,
you can proceed to delete it.
In order to do this,
first you need to go
to the **Scope** section
of the group you want to manage.

When you get to the **Scope** section,
scroll all the way down
until you see the part called
**Delete this group**
that has a button with the same name.
Be aware that this section
will only appear
if you have the appropiate authorization.

After clicking on this button
a window will appear
in which you will need to type the name
of the group you are currently managing.
Before this,
make sure that you want to proceed
with the deletion of the group,
as there is no going back
after you complete it.
With this consideration in mind,
after typing the name of the group,
click on **Confirm** button
to complete the deletion of the group.
