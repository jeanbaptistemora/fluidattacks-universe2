Services show us how my group configured,
which is composed of Subscription type,
Service,
and plan (Machine/Squad).

![Services](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1658842403/docs/web/groups/services/services_bar.png)

The services you can
change are as follows:

- **Subscription type:**
  There are two:
  [Continuous Hacking](/about/faq/estimation#continuous-hacking-with-squad-plan)
  or
  [One-Shot Hacking](/about/faq/estimation#one-shot-hacking-per-project).
- **Service:**
  [White](/about/glossary#white-box)
  and
  [Black](/about/glossary#black-box) services.
- **Plan:**
  [Machine](/machine/web/asm) and
  [Squad](/squad/reattacks).

You have the flexibility
to change these fields,
but all roots must be inactive.

To make these changes,
you have to select which
field you want to update,
then click on the continue button.

Here you will get a pop-up window
showing which fields have been
modified and which remain the same.
You also have to give observations
and the name of the group where
the change is being made.
When you verify that
everything is correct,
click on the **Confirm** button.
