- Add and edit the repositories that will be within the group's scope.
- Specify the environments that will undergo penetration tests (e.g., web and mobile
applications, APIs)
- Add files with necessary information or resources needed to perform the tests.
- Categorize your group by using portfolios and have an easier time managing multiple
groups.
