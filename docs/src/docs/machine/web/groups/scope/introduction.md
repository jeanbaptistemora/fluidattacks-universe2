that give you control over
the features of a specific group,
among them:

  that will be within
  the group's scope.
- Specify the environments
  that will undergo penetration tests
  (e.g., web and mobile applications, APIs)
- Add files with necessary information
  or resources needed to perform the tests.
- Categorize your group by using portfolios
  and have an easier time
  managing multiple groups.
