The tab of **Vulnerabilities** is the first one
you will see
when clicking on a group.
In this tab,
you will find a table
listing all the vulnerabilities in the group
and the **Reports** button,
which you can use
to request one of several types of reports
on all the vulnerabilities present there.

## Table of vulnerabilities

In this table,
you will find the vulnerabilities
categorized by their **type**
and you can organize them
by clicking on the various columns
described here:

- **Age (days):**
  The number of days elapsed
  since we first identified
  that specific type of vulnerability.
- **Open age (days):**
  The number of days passed
  since the oldest
  of all the open vulnerabilities
  was found,
  thus,
  if the vulnerability is closed,
  this number will be 0.
- **Last report (days):**
  The number of days passed
  since we found a vulnerability
  of that specific type,
  regardless of its open/closed status.
- **Type:**
  Depending on several characteristics
  of a single vulnerability,
  we can categorize them
  into various groups.
  This column represents
  such categorization.
- **Description:**
  A brief explanation
  of what that type of vulnerability does.
- **Severity:**
  This is the score given
  to that type of vulnerability.
  We use the CVSS
  (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)
  standard to assign each score.

- **Open:**
  This column shows the number of vulnerabilities
  that have not been resolved.
- **Status:**
  This column tells you "Open"
  if at least one vulnerability
  has not yet been resolved;
  otherwise,
  it will tell you "Closed."
- **Treatment:**
  This column shows you the treatments
  that can be given
  to a vulnerability.
  Each treatment has a number in front of it
  That represents the number of vulnerabilities
  receiving it.
- **Verification:**
  This column shows you
  if there is at least one vulnerability
  that is still in the process
  of being reattacked for verification.
- **Exploitable:**
  This column tells you
  whether the vulnerability can be exploited
  or not
  according to the score given
  to the specific type.
- **Where:**
  This column shows you
  several specific locations of vulnerabilities.
  However,
  if there are too many vulnerabilities
  of the same type,
  you should click on it
  and access the **Location** tab
  to see them all.

## Reports

In the Vulnerabilities tab,
you can also request
various vulnerability reports
by clicking on the **Reports** button
shown in the following image:

![Reports Button](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1622211894/docs/web/groups/vulnerabilities/reports_button_yzszmw.webp)

When you click on it,
the following window will appear:

![Reports Modal](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1622211894/docs/web/groups/vulnerabilities/reports_modal_h26dmp.webp)

There are three types of reports
you can request:

- **Executive:**
  This will give you a more summary report
  of all vulnerabilities
  in line with necessary knowledge
  from a management perspective.
- **Technical:**
  This will give a much more in-depth look
  at all the group's vulnerabilities,
  being suitable for those
  that want all the technical details.
- **Export:**
  This will give you a zip file
  with an export of all vulnerabilities
  in the group.

Lastly,
in order to download the report,
you need to check your email
and click on the **Download** button
that you can see in the following image:

![Reports Mail](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1622211894/docs/web/groups/vulnerabilities/reports_mail_zjkigl.webp)

The downloaded file will be protected
with a passphrase
that we will send
to your mobile device.
You can refer
to our [mobile app documentation](/machine/web/groups/vulnerabilities#reports)
if you encounter any problems
with this part of the process.

## Tracking tab

Knowing what happened with each
vulnerability is quite important.
So, it is essential for your team to
obtain information such as dates, users
and justifications for each change in
the history of your security vulnerabilities.
For this purpose, thereâ€™s the
**Tracking tab** in the ASM.
This tab gives you detailed information
about each vulnerability in your
software and the treatment each has
received over time.

You can find the **Tracking tab** in
two different places.
One is in each specific vulnerability
type, where you can have a global overview.

![First Tracking Tab](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1643990395/docs/web/groups/vulnerabilities/vulner_first_tracking_tab.png)

The second **Tracking tab** can be accessed
by first clicking on the **Locations** tab
in a vulnerability type and then clicking
on a specific location where the
vulnerability was found.
There you can find the tab, which will show
you individual details on the file you chose.
