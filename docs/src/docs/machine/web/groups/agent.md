Sometimes you need to generate a
new Token for your agent or know
how to install it in your pipeline.
You can do it with the DevSecOps
Agent section in the Scope tab.

![Scope Tab](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1658852106/docs/web/groups/agent/scope_tab.png)

This section allows you to do
two actions: **Install** and
create a new **Token**.
Clicking on **Install** will
redirect you to the documentation,
which describes how to do the
installation step by step.
The **Manage Token** option
will generate a new token to
add or update in your pipeline.

Clicking on Reveal Token
will show you the token.
Remember that each token is
unique and different for each group.
