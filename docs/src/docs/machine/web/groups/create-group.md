You may have several
groups corresponding to
separate applications,
infrastructure or source code.
When you create a group,
the ethical hackers at
`Fluid Attacks` start
assessing it in search
for vulnerabilities.

To start creating a new group,
you need to click on the
**New group** button in the
main screen of your organization.

![New Group Option](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1649200085/docs/web/groups/creation/creation_new_group_option.png)

A pop-up window will appear
to set up the characteristics
of your new group.
You will be asked to provide
the following:

- **Description:**
  Write a description that
  will help you identify the
  project to which that
  group is associated,
  since the group's name
  is randomly generated.
- **Type of service:**
  Select between Continuous
  Hacking and One-Shot Hacking.
- **Type of testing:**
  Select between white- and
  black-box testing.
- **Report language:**
  Select a language in which
  you would like your reports
  to be.
- **Include Machine Plan:**
  Select if you would like
  to activate Machine Plan,
  which performs security
  testing with `Fluid Attack's`
  automatic security testing
  tools only.
- **Include Squad Plan:**
  Select if you would like
  to activate Squad Plan,
  which extends the capabilities
  of Machine Plan to include
  manual pentesting,
  achieving the detection of
  zero-day vulnerabilities
  and low rates of false
  positives and false negatives.
  To use Squad Plan,
  you have to also enable
  Machine Plan.
