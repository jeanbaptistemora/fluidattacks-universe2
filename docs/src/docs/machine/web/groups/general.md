## Create new group

You may have several
groups corresponding to
separate applications,
infrastructure or source code.
When you create a group,
the ethical hackers at
`Fluid Attacks` start
assessing it in search
for vulnerabilities.

To start creating a new group,
you need to click on the
**New group** button in the
main screen of your organization.

![New Group Option](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1667248754/docs/web/groups/general/new_group.png)

A pop-up window will appear
to set up the characteristics
of your new group.
You will be asked to provide
the following:

- **Group name:**
  Enter a name for your group.
  It is recommended to choose a
  short one that is easy to remember.
- **Description:**
  Write a description that
  will help you identify the
  project to which that
  group is associated.
- **Type of service:**
  Select between Continuous
  Hacking and One-Shot Hacking.
- **Type of testing:**
  Select between [white-box](/about/glossary/#white-box)
  and [black-box](https://docs.fluidattacks.com/about/glossary/#black-box)
  testing.
- **Report language:**
  Select a language in which
  you would like your reports
  to be.
- **Include Squad Plan:**
  Select if you would like
  to activate Squad Plan,
  which extends the capabilities
  of Machine Plan to include
  manual pentesting,
  achieving the detection of
  zero-day vulnerabilities
  and low rates of false
  positives and false negatives.
  To use Squad Plan,
  you have to also enable
  Machine Plan.

When you are finished
setting up your new group,
you can click **Confirm**.
The group will be added to
your group table immediately,
and you will be all set to
start working on your project.

## Group filters

Filters allow you to limit
the data you visualize,
facilitating your search.
The Group section has a
**Filters** button which,
upon click,
allows you to filter your
group search by either group
name or plan
([Machine Plan](/about/faq/machine),
[Squad Plan](/about/faq) or
[One-Shot](/about/faq/estimation#one-shot-hacking-per-project)).

## Group table

In the group table,
you find all the groups you
have access to within your
organization.
This table has five columns,
each of which allows you to
organize the list content
alphabetically (either
ascending or descending) if
you click on the arrows next
to each title.

You find the following information:

- **Group name:**
  The first column shows you
  the names of the groups.
- **Description:**
  The next column gives you the
  short descriptions the groups
  received at their creation.
- **Plan:**
  You can see the plan to which each
  group belongs.
- **Role:**
  The role within each of them.
- **Events:**
  The last column tells you how
  many unsolved events each group
  has (to learn more about this column,
  we invite you to
  [click here](/machine/web/groups/general#unsolved-events)).

When you enter a group,
following the link in its name,
you can see its detailed information
in different subsections,
which will vary depending on
your role and the plan you have
for that group.

> **NOTE:**
> You can edit or [remove](/machine/web/groups/delete/) a group
> in its [Scope](/machine/web/groups/scope) section.

## Open eventualities

### Unsolved events

In the group table,
you find a column
called Events.
In this column,
you can discover how many
unsolved events need your
attention in each of your groups.

![Unsolved Events Tab](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1649263029/docs/web/groups/general/unsolved_events_tab.png)

When you enter one of the
groups with at least one
unsolved event,
you can notice a red dot
in the Events tab,
which works as a warning
signal that something
requires your intervention.

![Warning Signal](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1649263029/docs/web/groups/general/unsolved_events_warning_sig.png)

When you click that tab,
you see the event table
with a Status column showing
for each event whether it is
solved (in green) or unsolved
(in red).
