Upon entering
one of your groups
you can access
its **Authors** section
by clicking on the corresponding tab.
When you click on it,
the **ASM** will show you
all of the authors
that have contributed
to the development
of the application
that corresponds to your group.

Depending on the number
of authors
that a group has
the pricing of the **Squad** plan varies,
so as you can see,
**ASM** shows every author
only once,
all the groups
that such author
has contributed in
and a single commit
as an example
of the contributions
they have made.

## Invite authors

When we talk about
authors on the ASM,
we refer to all developers
or professionals who have
contributed to the
repositories of the groups
under evaluation.
Their contribution makes
it especially important
that all of them be part
of our attack surface
management platform.
That is why you,
as a user manager,
can send registration
invitations to your
developers who do not have
an ASM account yet.
To find out who they are
and send them the invitations,
you need to be in one of your
groups and go to the
**Authors** tab.

![Authors Tab](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1648072503/docs/web/groups/authors/authors_tab.png)

In the **Registered** column,
you can see which authors are
registered and to whom you can
send the invitation.
When you click on the **Invite** button,
the ASM will email the
author showing them two
possible options: Confirm
access and Reject access.

![Registered Column](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1648072503/docs/web/groups/authors/registered_column.png)

During the time it takes
the author to respond to
the registration invitation,
you will see the Registered
column showing a Pending
status for the author in
question.

![Column With Pending Status](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1648072503/docs/web/groups/authors/authors_pending_status.png)

If the author rejects the invitation,
the status will revert to Invite,
whereas if the author accepts the invitation,
the status will become Registered.
