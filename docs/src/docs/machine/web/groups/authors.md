When we talk about
authors on the ARM,
we refer to all developers
or professionals who have
contributed to the
repositories of the groups
under evaluation.
You can access the
**Authors** section when you
enter one of your groups.

![Authors Section](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1675108456/docs/web/groups/authors/authors_table.png)

## Authors table

The Authors table shows us who has
contributed to the project or group.

- **Author:**
  The author name and the email
  registered in the ARM.
- **Groups Contributed:**
  Name of the group to which the
  author contributes.
- **Commit:**
  The first author commit of the month.
- **Repository:**
  The first repository that was
  detected in the month.
- **Registration status:**
  The registration status can be:
  Registered,
  pending,
  or invite.

## Functionalities

In this section of the **ARM**
we find the following functionalities:

### Filter per month

When you need to see the list
of authors for a specific month,
simply click on the date at the
top left to drop down a menu
with all the months of work
in that group.

### Export

You can download the list of
authors as a CSV (comma-separated
values) file by clicking on
the **Export** button.

### Filters

By clicking the **Filters** button,
which you can find on the
upper left-hand side,
you have three filters enabled to
apply to your listing:
**Author**,
**Groups Contributed**,
**Repository**.

### Search bar

The search bar filters the information
contained in the columns of the table.

## Invite authors

The notion of shared responsibility
for secure development makes it
especially important that all
of the contributors to any given
repository be part of our Attacks
Resistance Management platform.
If you are a user manager,
you can send registration
invitations to contributors
who do not have an ARM account yet
by clicking the **Invite** button.

![Authors Tab](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1675116938/docs/web/groups/authors/invite_authors.png)

The ARM will email the author
showing them two possible options:
Confirm access and Reject access.
During the time it takes the
author to respond to the
registration invitation,
you will see the Registration status
column showing a Pending status
for the author in question.

![Authors Section](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1675117042/docs/web/groups/authors/pending_status.png)

If the author rejects
the invitation,
the status will revert
to Invite,
whereas if the author
accepts the invitation,
the status will become
Registered.
