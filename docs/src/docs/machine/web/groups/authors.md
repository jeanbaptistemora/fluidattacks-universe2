When we talk about
authors on the ASM,
we refer to all developers
or professionals who have
contributed to the
repositories of the groups
under evaluation.
You can access the
**Authors** section when you
enter one of your groups.

![Authors Section](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1622745748/docs/web/groups/authors/authors_section_vlq2um.png)

You can see a list of
authors that contributed
in the last month.
It presents you their
name and email,
the groups they contribute to,
their latest commit,
the name of the repository
where they made that commit,
and whether or not they are
registered to the ASM.
See below how to invite them
to open an account in our
attack surface management
platform.

When you need to see the list
of authors for a specific month,
simply click on the date at the
top left to drop down a menu
with all the months of work
in that group.

## Export list of authors

You can download the list of
authors as a CSV (comma-separated
values) file by clicking on
the Export button.

## Filter listâ€‹ of authors

By clicking the **Filters** button,
you have four filters available
to apply to the list:
**Authors**,
**Groups contributed**,
**Repository** and **Invitation**.
In addition,
you can search for any data
contained in the list using
the box at the top right.

## Invite authors

The notion of shared responsibility
for secure development makes it
especially important that all
of the contributors to any given
repository be part of our attack
surface management platform.
If you are a user manager,
you can send registration
invitations to contributors
who do not have an ASM account yet,
clicking on the **Invite** button.

![Authors Tab](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1648072503/docs/web/groups/authors/authors_tab.png)

The ASM will email the author
showing them two possible options:
Confirm access and Reject access.
During the time it takes the
author to respond to the
registration invitation,
you will see the Registered
column showing a Pending status
for the author in question.

![Authors Section](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1648072503/docs/web/groups/authors/authors_pending_status.png)

If the author rejects
the invitation,
the status will revert
to Invite,
whereas if the author
accepts the invitation,
the status will become
Registered.
