When the ASM was last deployed,
be it because of new features or
improvements to old features, is
not top secret information we
are keeping from our clients.
You can see this information by
clicking on the icon with the
letter **i** on the ASM’s
top-right menu.

Upon clicking, you will see the
commit hash ID (a commit’s unique
identifier) that corresponds
to the update.
Below, you will see the update
deployment date and time.
You can click on the commit hash
to see on GitLab the specific
lines of code that were changed,
the developer who made the change,
what was removed and added, and
on what file.
