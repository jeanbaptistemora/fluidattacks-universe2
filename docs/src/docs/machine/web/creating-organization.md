Creating an organization on
our ARM helps you to consolidate
the data in a specific place and
keep all your information in order.
On the top left, you can make a
list of your organizations appear
by clicking on the **drop-down menu**
icon next to your organization’s name.
Using the option **New org…**, you can
create as many organizations as you
want on your ARM account.

Give it a name, then click on **Proceed**
and your organization will be
created.

The organization drop-down menu
helps you navigate through your
organizations easily.
Its option to create new organizations
enables you to keep your groups
and vulnerability management more
orderly.
