Creating an organization on
our ASM helps you to consolidate
the data in a specific place and
keep all your information in order.
On the top left, you can make a
list of your organizations appear
by clicking on the **drop-down menu**
icon next to your organization’s name.
Using the option **New…**, you can
create as many organizations as you
want on your ASM account.

![New Option In Menu](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1645711057/docs/web/web_asm_new_ddmenu.png)

The organization name will be
randomly generated for you.
You need to click on **Proceed**
and your organization will be
created.

The organization drop-down menu
helps you navigate through your
organizations easily.
Its option to create new organizations
enables you to keep your groups
and vulnerability management more
orderly.
