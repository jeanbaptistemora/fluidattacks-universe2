An organization in the ARM refers
to the different macro projects
that the company has,
which are divided into other subprojects
[Groups](machine/web/groups/)
where you consolidate the
data to analyze.

## Creating an organization using drop-down menu

Creating an organization on
our ARM helps you to consolidate
the data in a specific place and
keep all your information in order.
On the top left, you can make a
list of your organizations appear
by clicking on the **drop-down menu**
icon next to your organization’s name.
Using the option **New org…**, you can
create as many organizations as you
want on your ARM account.

and your organization will be
created.

helps you navigate through your
organizations easily.
Its option to create new organizations
enables you to keep your groups
and vulnerability management more
orderly.
