Self-enrollment is aimed at `Fluid Attacks'`
potential clients actively seeking
assistance to detect security
vulnerabilities in their systems.
We offer them a 21-day free trial
of our Continuous Hacking Machine
Plan (automated testing service),
in which they will have the
opportunity to explore our
[Attack Surface Manager (ASM)](/machine/web/asm)
platform.
Here is a short step-by-step guide
to enroll in this free trial.

First,
you have to go to the official
website of our [ASM](/machine/web/asm).
There you need to log in with a Google,
Microsoft or Bitbucket business
email account.
You must not have
registered at ASM before,
and only one user per organization
is allowed to complete the free
trial registration.

![Log In](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1654783880/docs/web/enrollment/enrollment_login.png)

Having logged in,
you will see a window where
you are asked to enter the
details about the repository
you want us to assess.
Once you have filled out the fields,
click on the Check access button.

![Info Repositories](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1654783881/docs/web/enrollment/enrollment_repository.png)

If the details you
provided are valid,
click the **Next** button.
You will see a new window asking you to create your
[organization](/machine/web/creating-organization)
and [group](/machine/web/groups).

![Create Group](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1654783880/docs/web/enrollment/enrollment_creating.png)

After providing the
requested information,
click on the
**Start your free trial now** button.
From there,
it is a matter of waiting a
few hours while we clone your
repository and perform the
first security scan.

![Notification Free Trial](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1654783880/docs/web/enrollment/enrollment_notif.png)

In the meantime,
you will receive an enrollment
notification via email,
where we welcome you to
the Machine Plan free trial.

You can also access your
organization and group on
the ASM and start exploring
the platform.

Once vulnerabilities
start being detected,
you will be receiving
notifications in your email.

![Vulnerabilities Alert](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1654783881/docs/web/enrollment/enrollment_vuln_notification.png)

By clicking the
**Manage vulnerabilities now** button,
you will be directed to the
[Vulnerabilities](/machine/web/groups/vulnerabilities)
section of your group.
There you can select any of the
types of vulnerabilities and view
their [locations](/machine/web/vulnerabilities/management)
to know where you need to
initiate remediation.
We invite you to follow
[this link](/machine/web/vulnerabilities/management)
for more information about
managing your vulnerabilities
from the ASM.

When your 21-day free trial
is about to run out,
you will receive messages to
decide if you want to extend
it for nine more days or
become a client of `Fluid Attacks`
to use Machine Plan without
limitations.
You can even talk to our staff
to know about and request the
comprehensive and more accurate
Squad Plan (automated and manual
testing service).

![End Free Trial](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1654783880/docs/web/enrollment/enrollment_21days.png)

If you click on the link to
start paying for Machine Plan,
you will be taken to the ASM
and see a window to enter
your payment details.
If the transaction is successful,
you will be able to continue
testing the security of your
systems with our automated tools.
