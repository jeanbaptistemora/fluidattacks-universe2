Self-enrollment is aimed at `Fluid Attacks'`
potential clients actively seeking
assistance to detect security
vulnerabilities in their systems.
We offer them a 21-day free trial
of our Continuous Hacking Machine
Plan (automated testing service),
in which they will have the
opportunity to explore our
[Attacks Resistance Management (ARM)](/machine/web/arm)
platform.
Here is a short step-by-step guide
to enroll in this free trial.

First,
you need to go to `Fluid Attacks’`
[homepage](https://fluidattacks.com/).
There,
you will find the
Start free trial button.
Click on it to access the
free trial landing page.

![Fluid Attacks Homepage](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1663009959/docs/web/enrollment/home_page_fluid.png)

The landing page states that
self-enrollment is for a 21-day
free trial of the Continuous
Hacking Machine Plan and lists
this plan’s benefits.
To proceed,
click on Start your Machine Plan.

![Fluid Attacks Landing Page](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1663010106/docs/web/enrollment/page_landing.png)

You will be taken to the
official website of our
[ARM](https://app.fluidattacks.com/).
There you need to log in with a Gmail,
Microsoft or Bitbucket business
email account.
You must not have
registered at ARM before,
and only one user per organization
is allowed to complete the free
trial registration.

As we said,
only new users can create an
account and log in.
If so,
you will be welcome and encouraged
to start the free trial.

you want us to assess.

From there,
it is a matter of waiting a
few hours while we clone your
repository and perform the
first security scan.

section of your group.
There you can select any of the
types of vulnerabilities and view
their [locations](/machine/web/vulnerabilities/management)
to know where you need to
initiate remediation.
We invite you to follow

is about to run out,
you will receive messages to
decide if you want to extend
it for nine more days or

limitations.
You can even talk to our staff

comprehensive and more accurate

testing service).
