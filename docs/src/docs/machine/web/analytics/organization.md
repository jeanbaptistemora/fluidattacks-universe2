## Remediation rate benchmarking

![Remediation Benchmarking](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1643925701/docs/web/analytics/organizations/organization_remediation_benchmarking.png)

How do your numbers compare to those of
other organizations? How close are you
to being the best?
Based on our 20 years of experience, we
can benchmark how your organization is
doing in terms of vulnerability remediation
as compared to other organizations.
This section shows the percentages of closed,
accepted and open vulnerabilities by their
severity for your organization and how your
numbers compare to those of the best, the
average and the worst organization.

## Open severity by groups

![Remediation Benchmarking](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1643925877/docs/web/analytics/organizations/organization_severity_groups.png)

For each of your groups, you can find out
the severity (CVSSF) of open vulnerabilities.

## How many vulnerabilities are remediated (closed)?
