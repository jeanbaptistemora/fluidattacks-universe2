## Exposure remediation rate (benchmark)

![Exposure Remediation Rate](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1643925701/docs/web/analytics/organizations/organization_remediation_benchmarking.png)

How do your numbers compare to those of
other organizations? How close are you
to being the best?
Based on our 20 years of experience,
we can benchmark how your organization
is doing in terms of vulnerability
remediation as compared to
other organizations.
This chart shows the
percentages of closed,
accepted and open risk exposure
in your organization,
as well as these percentages in
the best and the worst organization
and averaged across organizations
excluding yours.

For each of your groups, you can find out
the severity (CVSSF) of open vulnerabilities.
