## Remediation rate benchmark

![Remediation rate benchmark](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1643925701/docs/web/analytics/organizations/organization_remediation_benchmarking.png)

How do your numbers compare to those of
other organizations? How close are you
to being the best?
Based on our 20 years of experience,
we can benchmark how your organization
is doing in terms of vulnerability
remediation as compared to
other organizations.
This chart shows the
percentages of closed,
accepted and open risk exposure
in your organization,
as well as these percentages in
the best and the worst organization
and averaged across organizations
excluding yours.

## Exposure by group

![Exposure by Group](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1643925877/docs/web/analytics/organizations/organization_severity_groups.png)

For each of your groups, you can find out
the exposure (CVSSF) of open vulnerabilities.

## How many vulnerabilities are remediated and accepted?

temporarily accepted and permanently
accepted vulnerabilities categorized
by group.

![Unsolved events by group](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1646408695/docs/web/analytics/organizations/org_unsolved_events_groups.png)

Unsolved [events](/machine/web/groups/events)
refer to situations that arise
within a group that prevent our
experts from pentesting part of
the scope —or maybe all of it—
and have not been solved yet.
The above chart shows you how
many of these are in each of
your groups.
