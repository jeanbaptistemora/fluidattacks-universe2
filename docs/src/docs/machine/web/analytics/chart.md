The charts in the Analytics
sections have a diverse set
of options that can help you
better understand the information,
download it or modify its
presentation.
These are the chart options:

![Chart Analytics Tools](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1649181366/docs/web/analytics/chart/chart_analytics_tools.png)

## Filter

This option allows you to
select one variable (e.g.,
amount of time; target of
evaluation) based on which
you would like to limit the
information you see in the chart.
Not all charts have this button.

## Information

This option allows you to go
directly to the section of
[Fluid Attacks Documentation](https://docs.fluidattacks.com/)
where you find information
corresponding to the chart.

## Download

This option allows you to
download the chart as a
`.html` file.

## Refresh

This option allows you to
reload the chart when,
for some reason,
it is not possible to view
its data.
It also allows you to return
to the default view,
clearing any filters you
had applied by clicking
on a color label.

## Expand

This option allows you to
view the chart in a larger
size in a pop-up window.
