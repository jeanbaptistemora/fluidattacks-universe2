## Subscription to reports

The Analytics sections on
the ASM have a subscription
button that allows you to
subscribe to daily,
weekly or monthly emails.
These will show you analytics
corresponding to your
organization,
group or portfolio.

To subscribe,
you must first visit the Analytics
section of your interest.
You will find the subscription
button at the bottom.
The button text describes your
current subscription status.
Therefore,
if you are currently
unsubscribed to email reports
about that particular section,
the button will say **Unsubscribed**.
But if you are subscribed,
the button text will say so.
A drop-down menu will appear
when you hover on the button,
showing the different
subscription options.
Select the one you prefer and
the changes will be applied immediately.

Emails are sent at 6:00 AM (UTC-5).
If you subscribe monthly,
you will receive them the
first day of every month.
If you choose to subscribe weekly,
you will receive them every Monday.

There are two options at
the end of every email.
The **Download** button will
allow you to download the
information in that report.
The **Live** button will
redirect you to the
corresponding Analytics
section on the ASM.
