## Download reports

On the ARM,
you can download the charts
and data belonging to the
different Analytics sections.
To download the material
of your interest,
you have to go to one of
the Analytics sections,
either of one of your
organizations,
groups or portfolios,
and scroll to the bottom.
There,
you will find the
**Download** button.
