On the ASM, it is quite easy to
find the options to access the
platform’s API, configure what
notifications you want to receive
in your email, delete your
account, and log out.
These are shown on a drop-down
menu that appears when you click
the user icon on the upper-right
part of your screen.
Your username, email address and
role are shown as well.

![User Drop Down Menu](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1646335539/docs/web/web_asm-user_dropdown_menu.png)

The first information on
this menu is your username,
email address with which
you signed in and your
mobile phone number which
one you subscribe to the ASM.
Remember your privileges
are attached to this
email address.
Differences in access
privileges are managed depending
on your role on the ASM,
which is also shown on this menu.
You can find out
more about roles
[here](/machine/web/groups/roles).
(Be sure to check out the
[role table](/machine/web/groups/roles/#roles-table).)

Under the user role information,
there’s an option that says **API**.
Clicking on it will allow you to
generate an access token to
consume the ASM’s API.
You will be asked to set its
expiration date before generating it.
You can find out more about
this under
[this link](/machine/api/#using-the-asm-api-token).

Next is the
**Notifications** option,
which allows you to select
which notifications you
want to receive.
When you click on it,
you will see the
**Notifications** matrix
that shows you all the
reports and alerts that
our ASM generates.
There you can toggle the
on/off button to enable
or disable the delivery
of each notification to
your registered email.

The next option
is **Mobile**,
which allows you to
register your mobile
phone number to the ASM.
This registration is
required to access
the ASM reports.

When you click on
the Mobile option,
you will see a window
where you must add your
number and then enter
the verification code
sent to you via SMS to
complete the registration.

Next on the menu is the
**Delete account** option.
This will allow you to delete
your account if you are no
longer using the ASM.
Your access privileges will
be deleted along with the account.
Before proceeding, a warning
message will appear, reminding
you that you will not be able
to restore your account afterward.

Lastly, the **Log out**
option will allow you to end
your session on the ASM.
