On the ASM, it is quite easy to
find the options to access the
platform’s API, configure what
notifications you want to receive
in your email, delete your
account, and log out.
These are shown on a drop-down
menu that appears when you click
the user icon on the upper-right
part of your screen.
Your username, email address and
role are shown as well.

![User Drop Down Menu](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1646335539/docs/web/web_asm-user_dropdown_menu.png)

The first information on this menu
is your username and email address
with which you signed in.
Your privileges are attached to this
email address.
Differences in access privileges
are managed depending on your role
on the ASM, which is also shown
on this menu.
You can find out more about roles
[here](/machine/web/groups/roles).
(Be sure to check out the
[role table](/machine/web/groups/roles/#roles-table).)

Under the user role information,
there’s an option that says **API**.
Clicking on it will allow you to
generate an access token to
consume the ASM’s API.
You will be asked to set its
expiration date before generating it.
You can find out more about
this under
[this link](/machine/api/#using-the-asm-api-token).

Next is the
**Notifications** option,
which allows you to select
which notifications you
want to receive.
When you click on it,
you will see the
**Notifications** matrix
that shows you all the
reports that our ASM
generates.
There you can press the
On/Off button to accept
or reject the sending of
each notification to your
registered email.

Next on the menu is the
**Delete account** option.
This will allow you to delete
your account if you are no
longer using the ASM.
Your access privileges will
be deleted along with the account.
Before proceeding, a warning
message will appear, reminding
you that you will not be able
to restore your account afterward.

Last but not least, the **Log out**
option will allow you to end
your session on the ASM.
