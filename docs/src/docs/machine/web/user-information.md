On the ASM, it is quite easy to
find the options to enable early
access to changes to the platform,
create and manage credentials,
register your mobile phone number,
access the platform’s API,
configure what notifications you
want to receive in your email,
delete your account,
and log out.
These are shown on a drop-down
menu that appears when you click
the user icon on the upper-right
part of your screen.
Your username,
email address and role
are shown as well.

![User Drop Down Menu](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1646335539/docs/web/web_asm-user_dropdown_menu.png)

The first information on
this menu is your username,
followed by the email address
with which you signed in and
your mobile phone number which
one you subscribe to the ASM.
Remember your privileges are
attached to this email address.

Differences in access
privileges are managed depending
on your role on the ASM,
which is also shown on this menu.
You can find out
more about roles
[here](/machine/web/groups/roles)
(be sure to check out the
[role table](/machine/web/groups/roles/#roles-table)).
Below the user role information is
the **Feature preview** option,
which you can toggle on to enable
early access to changes to the
platform features,
i.e.,
before they are officially released.

Further down,
there’s an option that says **API token**.
Clicking on it will allow you to
generate an access token to
consume the ASM’s API.
You will be asked to set its
expiration date before generating it.
You can find out more about
this under
[this link](/machine/api/#using-the-asm-api-token).

Next is the
**Notifications** option,
which allows you to select
which notifications you
want to receive.
When you click on it,
you will see the
**Notifications matrix**
that shows you all the
reports and alerts that
our ASM generates.
Learn more about how you
can manage notifications
[here](/machine/web/notifications).

The next option is **Credentials**,
which allows you to
create and manage credentials.
From here you can also manage
the credentials you entered
when adding a root in the
Scope section.
Follow
[this link](/machine/web/groups/scope/machine/web/groups/scope/global-credentials)
to learn the entire procedure.

Next is **Mobile**,
which allows you to
register your mobile
phone number to the ASM.
This registration is
required to access
the ASM reports.

![Mobile Option](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1651073721/docs/web/web_asm-user_mobile_menu.png)

When you click on
the Mobile option,
a pop-up window will appear.
If you had not registered
your mobile phone before,
you will be asked to
add your number and then
enter the verification code
sent to you via SMS to
complete the registration.
However,
if you had already registered it,
you will be presented with
the option to change it.
To do this,
you will need to click on
Edit and follow a verification
procedure.

Next on the menu is the
**Delete account** option.
This will allow you to delete
your account if you are no
longer using the ASM.
Your access privileges will
be deleted along with the account.
Before proceeding, a warning
message will appear, reminding
you that you will not be able
to restore your account afterward.

![Delete Account](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1646335539/docs/web/web_asm-user_delete_account.png)

Lastly, the **Log out**
option will allow you to end
your session on the ASM.
