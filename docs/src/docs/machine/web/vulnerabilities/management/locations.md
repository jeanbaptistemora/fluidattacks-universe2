In locations,
you can view all vulnerabilities
found of that specific type.
In this view,
you can see detailed information
about the specific location.
We will start explaining the
section header.

## Header of the type of vulnerability

In the **header** there are
useful global information.
Above the header, as a title,
you find the name of the type
of vulnerability you selected.
There are many kinds of errors
or problems that can exist in
a given software, as well as
many ways to exploit them.
All of these types of vulnerabilities
have specific names, and you
can access [a vast list](/criteria/vulnerabilities/)
that we are constantly updating on our
[Documentation](https://docs.fluidattacks.com/).

The first thing you see below
the title, on the far left, is
the **severity** level of that
type of vulnerability.
Specifically, it shows you a
number and its corresponding
qualitative rating.
The number is a score based on
the renowned Common Vulnerability
Scoring System (CVSS), an open
standard for assessing the
severity of security vulnerabilities
in IT systems.
CVSS scores go from 0.1 to 10.0.
The qualitative rating depends on
those scores: **low** from 0.1 to
3.9, **medium** from 4.0 to 6.9,
**high** from 7.0 to 8.9 and
**critical** from 9.0 to 10.0.
