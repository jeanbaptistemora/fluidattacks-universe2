Besides this there are other useful functionalities you can do here that
enable efficient management of your vulnerabilities:
- Define a treatment for each vulnerability
- Request that a vulnerability be reattacked
- Request a zero risk treatment for a vulnerability
- Check what information was compromised by this type of vulnerability,
if applicable
- Look at a script that replicates the exploitation process of the vulnerability,
if applicable
