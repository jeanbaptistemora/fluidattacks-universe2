If you want to organize your daily
work on ARM, you can use our To-Do
List feature.
Through this function, you can be
aware of all the vulnerabilities
assigned to you and have good
tracking in your daily tasks.
To access it, you just have to
click on the **To-Do List** icon
in the top bar or follow
[this link](https://app.fluidattacks.com/todos)

## To-Do List table

The To-do list table shows
us what vulnerabilities
are assigned to me,
and I am responsible
for solving them.
You find the following information:

- **Group name:**
  The name of the [group](/machine/web/groups)
  where that specific
  vulnerability is found,
  clicking on it redirects you
  to the vulnerability
  typology tab of the group.
- **Type:**
  The typology is that [vulnerability](/criteria/vulnerabilities/).
  When you click on it you
  will be redirected to the
  description of that location.
- **Vulnerability:**
  Where it is located,
  the vulnerability.
- **Evidence:**
  Clicking on view will
  redirect you to the
  [evidence](/machine/web/vulnerabilities/management/vulnerability-description#evidence)
  tab in the locations tab.
- **Tags:**
  The tags that you put at the
  time of assigning the vulnerability.
