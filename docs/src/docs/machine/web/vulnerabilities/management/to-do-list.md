If you want to organize your daily
work on ARM, you can use our To-Do
List feature.
Through this function, you can be
aware of all the vulnerabilities
assigned to you and have good
tracking in your daily tasks.
To access it, you just have to
click on the **To-Do List** icon
in the top bar or follow
[this link](https://app.fluidattacks.com/todos)
(/todos).

However,
an initial question could be:
How can we assign vulnerabilities
to our team?
Enter this link,
and you will see how to do it!

## Filtering your To-Do List

Filters are useful tools that
allow you to analyze data quickly.
The **To-Do** section is equipped
with filters that can help you
visualize the vulnerabilities
that have been assigned to you
according to specific attributes.

![To Do Filters](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1645796934/docs/web/vulnerabilities/management/filtering_tdlist_filters.png)

There are six filters.
From left to right, the first
one is **Treatment**.
This field will let you filter
vulnerabilities in terms
of their assigned
[treatment](/machine/web/vulnerabilities/management/treatments).
You can select one of the
four possible treatments.

Next is **Treatment Acceptance**.
This field will present you with
two options corresponding to
whether the request to accept a
vulnerability, either temporarily
or permanently, has been accepted
or is still pending.

Up next is **Search Tag**.
It is technically a search box
where you can type the name of
the tag by which you would like
to filter the list.
Further to the right is the
**Group Name** filter.
By clicking on it, you can select
one of the groups you are part
of to visualize the vulnerabilities
you have been assigned from that group.

Moving to the next field is
the **Reattacks** filter.
It allows you to filter your
to-do list by the status of
[treatment](/squad/reattacks/),
which can be either
**Requested** or **Verified**.

The last option is to filter by
**Report date (Range)**.
For the purpose of filtering
vulnerabilities reported within
a date range, there is a start
date and an end date field.
You can type a specific date in
each field to create the date
range that you want to visualize.

If you want to clear all the
filters that you have applied,
simply click on the
**Clear Filters** button.
