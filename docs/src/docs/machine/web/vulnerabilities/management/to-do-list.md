If you want to organize your daily
work on ARM, you can use our To-Do
List feature.
Through this function, you can be
aware of all the vulnerabilities
assigned to you and have good
tracking in your daily tasks.
To access it, you just have to
click on the **To-Do List** icon
in the top bar or follow
[this link](https://app.fluidattacks.com/todos)
(/todos).

However,
an initial question could be:
How can we assign vulnerabilities
to our team?
Enter this link,
and you will see how to do it!

## To-Do List table

Moving to the next field is
the **Reattacks** filter.
It allows you to filter your
to-do list by the status of
[treatment](/squad/reattacks/),
which can be either
**Requested** or **Verified**.

The last option is to filter by
**Report date (Range)**.
For the purpose of filtering
vulnerabilities reported within
a date range, there is a start
date and an end date field.
You can type a specific date in
each field to create the date
range that you want to visualize.

If you want to clear all the
filters that you have applied,
simply click on the
**Clear Filters** button.
