If you want to organize your daily
work on ASM, you can use our To-Do
List feature.
Through this function, you can be
aware of all the vulnerabilities
assigned to you and have good
tracking in your daily tasks.
To access it, you just have to
click on the **To-Do List** icon
in the top bar or follow
[this link](https://app.fluidattacks.com/todos)
(/todos).

However, an initial question could
be: How can we assign vulnerabilities
to our team? Don't worry!
Here we explain how.

First, you need to go to the
**Vulnerabilities** section and
select the type of vulnerability
you want to treat.

After that, you must click on the
specific location of the vulnerability
you intend to assign to your team.
Immediately, a pop-up window will
appear, showing you three tabs, from
which you need to select the one
called **Treatments**.

There, you must fill in all the
fields with the requested information.
For example, in the **Assigned** field,
you have to enter the email address
of the developer or team member who
will be in charge of fixing the
vulnerability.
Once you provide all the
required information, you must
click the **Proceed** button.

Right away, the new person responsible
for fixing the vulnerability will
receive an email notification telling
them about the new assignment, specifying
the type of vulnerability, the group
and the location.
Clicking the **Go to finding** button
will redirect them to the **Location**
section on the ASM.

The person who was assigned the
task will be able to find the
aforementioned **To-Do List**
function on the top-right menu
of the ASM, next to the
megaphone icon.
The number over the icon will
tell them how many vulnerabilities
are assigned to them.
Clicking on the icon will allow
them to see the vulnerability
locations they are responsible
for remediating.
