As time passes
and your project changes,
it becomes necessary to have
an efficient way of knowing
how has a type of vulnerability
evolved over time.
This can be visualized
in the **Tracking** tab
available within each type of vulnerability.

![Vulnerability Tracking Tab](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1649776737/docs/web/vulnerabilities/management/vulnerabilities_tracking.png)

The information
that can be seen here
will be divided in cycles
based on the date of the change
and the type of change that occurred.
Here you will be able
to visualize the amount of vulnerabilities
that were opened/closed in a specific date
and also the treatment
that a set amount of vulnerabilities
were given in a specific date,
mentioning its justification
and assigned user.
