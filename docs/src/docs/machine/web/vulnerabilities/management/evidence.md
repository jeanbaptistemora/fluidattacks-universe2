The **Evidence** tab corresponds
to a subsection where we provide
you with supporting proof of the
existence and exploitation of
the corresponding type of
vulnerability.
We present such evidence in pictures,
videos or GIFs when we identify
this type of vulnerability for
the first time in your system.
This evidence changes each time
we perform a reattack on this
type of vulnerability.
