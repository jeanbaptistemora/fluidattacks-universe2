## Vulnerability information

It is helpful for you to learn
the most relevant information
about the vulnerabilities
reported in your system.
This information includes
vulnerability status,
display of vulnerable code,
defined treatments and
tracking history.
We provide this information in
the **Vulnerability** pop-up
window that appears when you
click on any vulnerability in
the **Locations** tab or the
**To-do list** section.
This window has four tabs:
**Details**,
**Code**,
**Treatments**
and **Tracking**.

In the **Details** tab,
you can see the vulnerability’s
status –whether it is open or
closed–, location,
last reattack request date
and current treatment.

Next to details tab is code
is **Code** tab.
Here you can see the vulnerable
portion of the code,
being this a clear reference
where the vulnerability is pointed
out directly from the code.

In the **Treatments** tab,
you can modify the vulnerability’s
defined treatment.
