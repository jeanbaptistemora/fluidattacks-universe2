It is helpful for you to learn
the most relevant information
about the vulnerabilities
reported in your system.
This information includes
vulnerability status,
defined treatments and
tracking history.
We provide this information in
the **Vulnerability** pop-up
window that appears when you
click on any vulnerability in
the **Locations** tab or the
**To-do list** section.
This window has three tabs:
**Details**, **Treatments**
and **Tracking**.

In the **Details** tab,
you can see the vulnerability’s
status –whether it is open or
closed–, location,
last reattack request date
and current treatment.

In the **Treatments** tab,
you can modify the vulnerability’s
defined treatment.

Lastly,

you can learn how the
vulnerability has evolved
over time.
