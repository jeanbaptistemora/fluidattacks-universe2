After choosing to give
a Zero Risk treatment
to the selected vulnerability
you only need to add
a treatment justification,
this information will be used by us
to consider whether the vulnerability
actually poses no threat at all,
in which case
the vulnerability will be deleted,
however,
if we still consider there is a risk,
then it will remain reported.
