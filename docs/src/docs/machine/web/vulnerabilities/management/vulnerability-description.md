## Vulnerability assignment

To assign a vulnerability,
first you need to go to the
[Vulnerabilities](/machine/web/groups/vulnerabilities)
section and select the type of
vulnerability you want to treat.

![Vulnerability type](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1665063450/docs/web/vulnerabilities/management/vulnerability_type.png)

You can assign vulnerabilities
in **New** status or reassign
vulnerabilities in **Progress** status.
Also,
you can assign a person even if
you have previously applied
the two treatments:
**Temporarily accepted** and
**Permanently accepted**.

In a new vulnerability,
to assign it to someone,
you must click on the specific
location of the vulnerability.
After that,
a pop-up window will immediately appear,
showing you three tabs,
from which you need to select
the one called **Treatments**.
After that,
you must change de **New**
to **in progress** status
in the treatment field.

![Treatment vulnerability ](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1665063949/docs/web/vulnerabilities/management/treat_vulnerability.png)

Several fields will be activated here.
You must fill in all them
with the requested information.
In **Assigned**,
you add the email address of the
developer or team member who will
be in charge of fixing the
vulnerability.
After you provide all the
required information,
you must click the **Confirm button**.

![Assigned vulnerability](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1665080355/docs/web/vulnerabilities/management/assigned.png)

> **Note:**
> Only a Fluid Attacks staff member
> can assign a vulnerability to other
> Fluid member. In either case,
> the **Assigned** dropdown list will
> show only valid options for the
> assignment.

Right away,
the new person responsible for
fixing the vulnerability will
receive an email notification
telling them about the new assignment,
specifying the type of vulnerability,
the group and the location.
Clicking the **Go to type of vulnerability**
button will redirect them to
the Location section on the ARM.

![Assigned notification](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1665080517/docs/web/vulnerabilities/management/assigned_notification.png)

Now,
if you want to change the responsible
for a vulnerability,
it is possible.
In the Assigned field,
you have to put the email of the
new responsible;
this person will receive the
notification New Vulnerability
Assignment.

The person who was assigned the
task will be able to find the
aforementioned **To-DoList**
function on the top-right
menu of the ARM,
next to the megaphone icon.
The number over the icon will
tell them how many vulnerabilities
are assigned to them.
Clicking on the icon will
allow them to see the vulnerability
locations they are responsible
for remediating.

## Severity score

For the calculation of the
severity of vulnerabilities,
we use the Common Vulnerability
Scoring System (CVSS) version 3.1.
For more information go to the
following [link](/machine/web/vulnerabilities/new-vulnerability-types/new-vuln-severity/)

## Evidence

The **Evidence** tab corresponds
to a subsection where we provide
you with supporting proof of the
existence and exploitation of
the corresponding type of
vulnerability.
We present such evidence in pictures,
videos or GIFs when we identify
this type of vulnerability for
the first time in your system.
This evidence changes each time
we perform a reattack on this
type of vulnerability.

## Tracking

Here you find the history
of each Vulnerability.
For more information go
to the following
[link](/machine/web/vulnerabilities/management/tracking/).

## Records

Clicking on the **Records** tab,
you can see a section with a
table showing the information
our ethical hackers obtained
after exploiting the specific
type of vulnerability in your
system that you are exploring.
All the information included there,
which varies from case to case,
we consider to be sensitive and
relevant to your organization.
You might see financial
information (e.g.,
account numbers,
financial movements,
credit card numbers),
personal information (e.g.,
phone numbers,
contacts,
personal IDs,
physical addresses),
technical information (e.g.,
roles,
keys,
access tokens),
among others.
