## Locations table

When you select a type of
vulnerability in your group's
**Vulnerabilities** section,
you will be directed to a
subsection with specific
information about it.
The title is the name of the
type of vulnerability preceded
by the number we have assigned
to it in [our list](/criteria/vulnerabilities/).
Below it,
is the [header](/machine/web/vulnerabilities/management)
with global information about
that type of vulnerability.
And even further below,
you will notice that you are
in that type of vulnerability's
**Locations** tab,
which shows the locations table.
This table shows the
following information,
from the leftmost to the
rightmost column:

- **Location:**
  The files where
  this type of vulnerability
  has been reported.
  They can be understood as
  individual vulnerabilities
  of that type.
- **Specific:**
  In what
  lines of code,
  inputs (e.g.,
  password field)
  or ports each
  vulnerability was
  detected.
- **Status:**
  Whether each
  vulnerability has been
  closed (remediated) or
  remains open.
- **Report date:**
  The dates when
  vulnerabilities were reported.
- **Reattack:**
  Whether a
  reattack has been requested
  and is pending,
  is on hold,
  has been verified (open)
  or verified (closed).
  If this cell is blank,
  it should be interpreted
  that a reattack has not
  been requested.
- **Treatment:**
  The defined treatment
  for each vulnerability,
  which could be in progress,
  temporarily accepted,
  permanently accepted or
  zero risk.
- **Tags:**
  Any tags that you
  have given each vulnerability
  to identify it.

### Filters

In the
[Locations](/machine/web/vulnerabilities/management/vulnerability-description#locations-table)
subsection for each
type of vulnerability,
there is a **Filters**
button that offers you
six options to filter
the information presented
in the locations table.

## Description tab

Clicking on the **Description**
tab you will see a subsection
with concise technical
information about the type of
vulnerability you are exploring.
Among this information,
you will find what this type
of vulnerability consists of,
the security requirements with
which you are not complying,
the potential dangers this
represents,
and what actions you can
implement for remediating
this type of vulnerability
or mitigating risk.

this subsection,
we recommend you follow

## Severity score

For the calculation of the
severity of vulnerabilities,
we use the Common Vulnerability
Scoring System (CVSS) version 3.1.
For more information go to the
following [link](/machine/web/vulnerabilities/new-vulnerability-types/new-vuln-severity/)

## Evidence

The **Evidence** tab corresponds
to a subsection where we provide
you with supporting proof of the
existence and exploitation of
the corresponding type of
vulnerability.
We present such evidence in pictures,
videos or GIFs when we identify
this type of vulnerability for
the first time in your system.
This evidence changes each time
we perform a reattack on this
type of vulnerability.

## Consulting

You can post
any doubt,
comment,
or thought you
want to share with the
`Fluid Attacks` team or
