## Locations table

When you select a type of
vulnerability in your group's
**Vulnerabilities** section,
you will be directed to a
subsection with specific
information about it.
The title is the name of the
type of vulnerability preceded
by the number we have assigned
to it in [our list](/criteria/vulnerabilities/).
Below it,
is the [header](/machine/web/vulnerabilities/management)
with global information about
that type of vulnerability.
And even further below,
you will notice that you are
in that type of vulnerability's
**Locations** tab,
which shows the locations table.
This table shows the
following information,
from the leftmost to the
rightmost column:

- **Location:**
  The files where
  this type of vulnerability
  has been reported.
  They can be understood as
  individual vulnerabilities
  of that type.
- **Specific:**
  In what
  lines of code,
  inputs (e.g.,
  password field)
  or ports each
  vulnerability was
  detected.
- **Status:**
  Whether each
  vulnerability has been
  closed (remediated) or
  remains open.
- **Report date:**
  The dates when
  vulnerabilities were reported.
- **Reattack:**
  Whether a
  reattack has been requested
  and is pending,
  is on hold,
  has been verified (open)
  or verified (closed).
  If this cell is blank,
  it should be interpreted
  that a reattack has not
  been requested.
- **Treatment:**
  The defined treatment
  for each vulnerability,
  which could be in progress,
  temporarily accepted,
  permanently accepted or
  zero risk.
- **Tags:**
  Any tags that you
  have given each vulnerability
  to identify it.

## Notify button

You can also find in locations
**Notify button**
You can also find the locations
Notify button,
which helps us notify all
open locations of the
specific vulnerability type,
receiving a report of these.
Please note that this feature
will only appear for the
[User manager](/machine/web/groups/roles/#user-manager-role)
and [Vulnerability manager](/machine/web/groups/roles/#vulnerability-manager-role)
roles.

To receive this email,
Click on the **Notify button**.

![Notify button](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1666212867/docs/web/vulnerabilities/management/notify_button.png)

You will get a confirmation
pop-up window if you want
to receive the notification.

![confirmation window](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1666213023/docs/web/vulnerabilities/management/confirmation_window.png)

When you click **Notify**,
you will get an email called
Vulnerability Alert,
which has information about
this locations.

## Vulnerability assignment

To assign a vulnerability,
first you need to go to the
[Vulnerabilities](/machine/web/groups/vulnerabilities)
section and select the type of
vulnerability you want to treat.

![Vulnerability type](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1665063450/docs/web/vulnerabilities/management/vulnerability_type.png)

You can assign vulnerabilities
in **New** status or reassign
vulnerabilities in **Progress** status.
Also,
you can assign a person even if
you have previously applied
the two treatments:
**Temporarily accepted** and
**Permanently accepted**.

In a new vulnerability,
to assign it to someone,
you must click on the specific
location of the vulnerability.
After that,
a pop-up window will immediately appear,
showing you three tabs,
from which you need to select
the one called **Treatments**.
After that,
you must change de **New**
to **in progress** status
in the treatment field.

![Treatment vulnerability ](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1665063949/docs/web/vulnerabilities/management/treat_vulnerability.png)

Several fields will be activated here.
You must fill in all them
with the requested information.
In **Assigned**,
you add the email address of the
developer or team member who will
be in charge of fixing the
vulnerability.
After you provide all the
required information,
you must click the **Confirm button**.

![Assigned vulnerability](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1665080355/docs/web/vulnerabilities/management/assigned.png)

> **Note:**
> Only a Fluid Attacks staff member
> can assign a vulnerability to other
> Fluid member. In either case,
> the **Assigned** dropdown list will
> show only valid options for the
> assignment.

Right away,
the new person responsible for
fixing the vulnerability will
receive an email notification
telling them about the new assignment,
specifying the type of vulnerability,
the group and the location.
Clicking the **Go to type of vulnerability**
button will redirect them to
the Location section on the ARM.

![Assigned notification](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1665080517/docs/web/vulnerabilities/management/assigned_notification.png)

Now,
if you want to change the responsible
for a vulnerability,
it is possible.
In the Assigned field,
you have to put the email of the
new responsible;
this person will receive the
notification New Vulnerability
Assignment.

The person who was assigned the
task will be able to find the
aforementioned **To-DoList**
function on the top-right
menu of the ARM,
next to the megaphone icon.
The number over the icon will
tell them how many vulnerabilities
are assigned to them.
Clicking on the icon will
allow them to see the vulnerability
locations they are responsible
for remediating.

For more information go to the
following [link](/machine/web/vulnerabilities/new-vulnerability-types/new-vuln-severity/)

## Evidence

The **Evidence** tab corresponds
to a subsection where we provide
you with supporting proof of the
existence and exploitation of
the corresponding type of
vulnerability.
We present such evidence in pictures,
videos or GIFs when we identify
this type of vulnerability for
the first time in your system.
This evidence changes each time
we perform a reattack on this
type of vulnerability.

## Records

Clicking on the **Records** tab,
you can see a section with a
table showing the information
our ethical hackers obtained
