`Fluid Attacks'` Attack Surface Manager (ASM)
comes with all functions you need
to manage all your applications
and vulnerabilities effectively.

To access this platform
you can click [here](https://app.fluidattacks.com).

## Login

To authenticate in the ASM,
you need a valid user
in at least one of these providers:

- Google
- Azure
- Bitbucket

For added security,
we do not manage users,
credentials
or MFA (multi-factor authentication).
We adopt our customers' policies.

## Organizations

All customer data is consolidated
in this ASM's section.
Each organization has a data bucket
that only users of that organization
can access.

In this section,
you will find the following subsections
(see the right-hand menu):

### Creating an organization using the drop-down menu

Creating an organization on
our ASM helps you to consolidate
the data in a specific place and
keep all your information in order.
On the top left, you can make a
list of your organizations appear
by clicking on the **drop-down menu**
icon next to your organization’s name.
Using the option **New…**, you can
create as many organizations as you
want on your ASM account.

![New Option In Menu](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1645711057/docs/web/web_asm_new_ddmenu.png)

The organization name will be
randomly generated for you.
You need to click on **Proceed**
and your organization will be
created.

![Add New Organization Tab](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1645711057/docs/web/web_asm_add_new_org.png)

The organization drop-down menu
helps you navigate through your
organizations easily.
Its option to create new organizations
enables you to keep your groups
and vulnerability management more
orderly.

### Analytics

Charts and indicators
will help you know what is happening
with your applications.
Information presented,
among others,
includes the following:

- Vulnerabilities over time
- Vulnerability status
- Vulnerability treatment
- Average remediation time
- Top vulnerabilities

### Portfolios

In the Analytics subsection,
you have the data of all your groups.
But if you want analytics for only a subset,
you can go to the Portfolios subsection
(we employ the same charts and indicators).

Please check the tags
in [Scope](/machine/web/#scope)
for more information.

### Stakeholders

Some users can access
your organization's data,
but this permission
does not guarantee access
to groups or vulnerabilities,
only access to organization-level analytics and policies.

### Policies

You can use vulnerability treatments
to plan remediation.
To control the correct use of them,
you can define rules
that will apply to all groups
in your organization.

Policies to define:

1. Maximum number of calendar days
  a finding can be temporarily accepted
1. Temporary CVSS 3.1 score range
  within which a finding can be accepted
1. Maximum number of times
  a finding can be temporarily accepted

### Groups

You may have multiple apps
in your organization,
and you probably want to
keep their vulnerabilities separate.

You can have as many groups as you want.
One group for each application
or several groups for one application,
it is your choice.

In Groups section,
you will find:

#### Group analytics

As in the case of Organization Analytics,
Group Analytics have
all the information about your group.

#### DevSecOps

`Fluid Attacks'` ASM
includes an agent that
present in the CI pipelines
can break the build for open vulnerabilities.
This section shows
the result of recent executions
and more information such as the following:

- Execution date
- Execution status (secure or vulnerable)
- Checked vulnerabilities
- Strictness (Tolerant/Strict)
- Type (SAST/DAST)

#### Events

In the service execution,
many things can and will happen.
In the events,
our analysts can report
any situation that affects the service.
It can be a full or partial disruption
or merely a request for information.

#### Consulting

Communication is essential
to achieve the remediation goal.
You can post any doubt,
comment, or thought
you want to share
with the `Fluid Attacks` team
or your team in the Consulting tab.
This section works like a forum
where anyone can post and reply.

#### Group stakeholders

You have group access control here
to define who and what they can do.
When you give access to the group,
there are three role options available:

- User manager
- User
- Executive

To get more information about it,
check the Roles section.

#### Authors

List of git users
that commit code
to checked repositories.

#### Scope

For an ASM,
you need to define the surface
that the `Fluid Attacks` team will check.
The following information
is required to enable
the testing service:

- Roots:
  Git repositories
  where you version
  the application’s source code.
- Environments:
  URLs where applications are deployed.
- Files:
  Any information
  that could help the service.
- Tags:
  Keywords to build portfolios
  and get information and analytics
  for groups that share the tag.
- Services:
  Active services for the group.
- Deletion:
  Function to safely delete
  all group data.

#### Vulnerabilities

One of the main sections on the platforms
is where you find all the confirmed security issues
of your application.

This section is divided as follows:

##### Locations

Here you find the list
of all vulnerabilities
with their specific locations:
File and LoC,
URL and input or IP and port.

You can ask for a reattack
or change the treatment
for one or many vulnerabilities
as you want.

Also,
you can add tag
 or define a qualitative risk level.

##### Reattack

When a vulnerability is remediated,
you need to request the `Fluid Attacks` team
to reattack it and confirm
if it was indeed remediated.

You can check in the Locations table
which vulnerabilities were requested
to reattack and verify their remediation.
After verification,
the `Fluid Attacks` team
will inform you through the Consulting tab
about the results.

##### Treatments

Risk management is an essential part
of vulnerabilities management.
You can define different treatments
in the Locations tab:

- **New:**
  The vulnerability was reported,
  and there is no treatment defined.
- **In progress:**
  The vulnerability is going to be remediated
  and has a user responsible
  for that remediation.
- **Temporarily accepted:**
  You may not resolve the vulnerability
  and decide to coexist with the risk
  for some time.
  The platform accepts by default
  a maximum of six months.
  You can control this setting
  in the Organization Policies section.
- **Permanently accepted:**
  You may not resolve the vulnerability
  and decide to coexist
  with the risk forever.

##### Description

In this section you can discover
all required information
to understand reported vulnerabilities.

##### Severity

For the calculation
of the severity of vulnerabilities,
we use the Common Vulnerability Scoring System
(CVSS) version 3.1.

##### Evidence

We provide video examples and screenshots
to help you understand
the context of the vulnerabilities.

##### Tracking

Here you find the history of each Vulnerability.
What has happened to the vulnerabilities
since the first one was reported.
When and by whom
the treatment was closed or changed.

##### Records

Some vulnerabilities
can expose customer information;
for context,
we share the disclosed information in this section.
