We recognize that sometimes you need
guidance on ASM operations or one of
our services.
That is why we have the **Talk to an expert**
option on our platform, where, via
videoconference, you can request
any help you need.
In this way, we facilitate our communication
and can respond to you as quickly as possible.

- You can find this option within the
  drop-down menu of the question mark
  icon, located in the top-right
  corner of the ASM.

  calendar availability and schedule a
  videoconference according to your
  convenience to meet your information needs.

- After selecting the date and
  time, you need to enter some details
  to make the appointment.
  In addition, you can add guests: people
  from your team that you want to
  join the call.
  Then, you click on the blue
  **Schedule event** button.

- After that, you can see the
  pop-up window that gives you the
  information about the appointment,
  including the name of the expert
  you will talk to.

- Finally, you receive an email with
  an invitation to the appointment,
  which is included in your Google Calendar.

Our priority is to serve your
communication requests in the
best possible way.
We hope this option will be
of great benefit to you.
