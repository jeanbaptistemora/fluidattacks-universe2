If you have a question about any
feature of the ASM or need help
on how to use it, we recommend
you to get in touch using the
**Instant Live Chat** option.
Through this means, we provide you
with fast and personalized support
on minor issues for which it is not
necessary to schedule a video call
(in this case, the
[Talk to an expert](/machine/web/support/talk-expert/)
option would apply).

To find the **Live Chat** option,
go to the top-right corner of the
ASM and click on the question
mark icon.
Select **Live Chat** from the
drop-down menu.
A chat box will appear in the
right corner of your screen, and
you will be enabled to chat
with our Customer Support team.

You need to keep in mind that the
**Instant Live Chat** service is
available from 8:00 AM until
6:00 PM (GMT-5).
Outside these hours, the chat
boxâ€™s title bar will say
**Leave us a message**.
You will be asked for your email
address, the applicable product
and the kind of help you need.
You may then type your message
and send it.
Since email communication is much
slower than chatting, we recommend
that you provide us with as much
details as you can about the
problem you are having.
Our Customer Support will reply
to your message via email as
soon as possible.
