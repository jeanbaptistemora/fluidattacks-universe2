While using the
[Attack Surface Manager (ASM)](https://app.fluidattacks.com)
and managing your organization or groups,
you may have questions
about using the ASM in general.
For answering these questions,
there is a function
that allows you to chat
directly with us,
which you can find at any time
while browsing the ASM
in the top right corner of your screen.

You find a **question mark** button
that you can click
to bring up a small chat
in the lower right corner of your screen.

![Support Chat](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1622669090/docs/web/organizations/support/support_chat_kmc0bu.png)

Use this chat
to convey your questions to us,
and we will do our best
to help you as soon as possible.

There is also another option
to receive help from us,
and that is by reaching us
through our support email address:
help@fluidattacks.com

Use this address to send us
any questions you have,
just like with the chat.
However,
since email communication is much slower
than chatting,
we recommend that you provide us with
as much details as you can
about the problem you are having.
This way,
we won't have to ask you for more information
to help you,
and we will give you an appropiate answer
much faster.
