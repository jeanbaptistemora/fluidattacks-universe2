In this section,
we answer frequently asked questions
about our
[Attack Resistance Management](/machine/web/arm)
platform.

## Group

### What is a group?

Each [group](/machine/web/groups/general/#group-table)
corresponds to individual projects our
clients create to manage their
[vulnerabilities](/machine/web/groups/vulnerabilities/)
separately.
Inside a group on the
[ARM platform](/machine/web/arm/),
there are several sections that can be
accessed according to the
[role](/machine/web/groups/roles/)
and plan you are subscribed to.
For more information on groups and sections,
please see our [Documentation.](/machine/web/groups)

### Why do we advise you to create several groups?

It is recommended to create several
separate [groups](/machine/web/groups),
each dedicated to one project;
you can have better visibility of
[vulnerabilities](/machine/web/groups/vulnerabilities/)
for their management,
generate focused [reports](/machine/web/groups/reports/)
and certificates independently,
have an organized view of the
[analytics](/machine/web/analytics/),
and have a better track of the details of
each project you work on.

## Vulnerabilities

### What are vulnerabilities?

[Vulnerabilities](/criteria/vulnerabilities/)
are the noncompliance with cybersecurity
[requirements](/criteria/requirements/),
which are rules based on the several international
[standards](/criteria/compliance/)
we check in our comprehensive tests.

### What is the difference between Age and Last report in the Vulnerabilities table?

Age refers to how many days the
[vulnerability](/machine/web/groups/vulnerabilities)
has been open,
whereas last report is the total number
of days passed since the vulnerability
was last reported.

### How do I suggest that a vulnerability is a false positive?

Choose Request [zero risk](/machine/web/vulnerabilities/management/zero-risk/)
as its [treatment.](/machine/web/vulnerabilities/management/treatments)

### How can I see only the findings of the dynamic application security testing (DAST)?

Find the [search bar](/machine/web/groups/vulnerabilities#search-bar)
in the [Vulnerabilities table](/machine/web/groups/vulnerabilities).
By entering **"HTTP"** as a keyword,
you will see the great majority of
vulnerabilities as **“dynamic” (found through DAST)**

### How can I see vulnerabilities specific to a particular Git root?

In the [search bar](/machine/web/groups/vulnerabilities#search-bar)
that you can find in the
[Vulnerabilities table](/machine/web/groups/vulnerabilities),
enter the nickname of the repository
you are interested in,
and the table will show you only the
vulnerabilities reported in that repository.
