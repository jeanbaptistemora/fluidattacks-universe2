In this section,
we answer frequently asked questions
about our
[Attack Resistance Management](/machine/web/arm)
platform.

## Group

### What is a group?

Each [group](/machine/web/groups/general/#group-table)
corresponds to individual projects our
clients create to manage their
[vulnerabilities](/machine/web/groups/vulnerabilities/)
separately.
Inside a group on the
[ARM platform](/machine/web/arm/),
there are several sections that can be
accessed according to the
[role](/machine/web/groups/roles/)
and plan you are subscribed to.
For more information on groups and sections,
please see our [Documentation.](/machine/web/groups)

### Why do we advise you to create several groups?

It is recommended to create several
separate [groups](/machine/web/groups),
each dedicated to one project;
you can have better visibility of
[vulnerabilities](/machine/web/groups/vulnerabilities/)
for their management,
generate focused [reports](/machine/web/groups/reports/)
and certificates independently,
have an organized view of the
[analytics](/machine/web/analytics/),
and have a better track of the details of
each project you work on.
