This post will help you use the API,
which is built as a GraphQL 2 service
where you can consume data
using a common query language.
If you know how GraphQL works,
you can skip ahead
to the API Token post:

- The first step is
  to get some GraphQL knowledge,
  how it works
  and how to make queries to a GraphQL endpoint,
  you can do it in this
  [Introduction](https://graphql.org/learn/)
  in the official GraphQL site.

- It is recommended
  that before you face the API,
  learn how to make Queries and Mutations
  since these are the basics operations
  over any GraphQL endpoint.

- Once you get the basic knowledge
  about the main GraphQL concepts
  as Queries, Mutations, Fields,
  and Arguments,
  you are ready to explore the API:

    - Go to the API Token post
      and use Browser method to see info about you
      (in this case, your role in the application,
      remember that you have to previously log in on the ASM):

      ```
      query {
        me {
          role
        }
      }
      ```

    - If you want to get info about your projects,
      you can enhance the previous query to do it
      so, remember that,
      since Projects is a list of Project entities,
      whose are GraphQL entities,
      you must specify the items
      that you want from them,
      in this case, their names:

      ```
      query {
        me {
          projects {
            name
          }
        }
      }
      ```
