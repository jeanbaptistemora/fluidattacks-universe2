We continuously encourage our hackers to certify their knowledge. Usually, hackers start applying
for certificates after spending six (6) months in the company.
[Here](https://fluidattacks.com/about-us/certifications/) you can find a comprehensive list of
certifications that our team of hackers currently holds.
