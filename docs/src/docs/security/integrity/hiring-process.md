All job applicants must undergo an extensive [testing process](https://fluidattacks.com/careers)
to prove their technical capabilities and human values.

The technical part of the testing process involves solving programming and hacking challenges,
uploading them to a Git repository with highly strict linters and compilers, and ascending in an
[organizational ranking](https://autonomicmind.com/challenges/).

The human values section of the testing process includes creating a portfolio with the five most
important achievements of the candidate, going to the office during a training phase to work
alongside the team, and job interviews, among other things.
