Typical logs are also essential
for a non-repudiation policy to be successful.
Currently,
we store logs for:

- **Attack Surface Manager’s (ASM) logging system:**
[Attack Surface Manager (ASM)](https://app.fluidattacks.com/)
stores a historical status of projects,
findings, vulnerabilities,
and other critical components.
Changes made to these components
are always tied to a user and a date.
The historical status never expires.

- **Attack Surface Manager’s (ASM) error tracking system:**
It provides real-time logging of errors
that occur in its production environments.
It is especially useful for quickly detecting
new errors and hacking attempts.
These logs never expire.

- **Redundant data centers:**
These store comprehensive logs
of all our infrastructure components.
Logs here never expire.

- **DevSecOps execution:**
Whenever a client’s
[CI pipeline](https://fluidattacks.com/security/#CI)
runs DevSecOps,
logs containing information like who ran it,
vulnerability status,
and other relevant data are uploaded to our data centers,
allowing us to always know the current status of
our client’s DevSecOps service.
These logs never expire.

- **IAM authentication:**
Our IAM stores logs of login attempts made by users,
accessed applications,
and possible threats.
Logs here expire after seven (7) days.

- **Collaboration systems activity:**
Our collaboration systems such as email, calendar, etc.,
store comprehensive logs of employee activity,
spam, phishing and malware emails,
suspicious login attempts,
and other potential threats.
Employee activity logs never expire.
Other security logs expire after 30 days.

- **CI job logs:**
All our [CI pipelines](https://fluidattacks.com/security/#CI)
provide a full record of who triggered them,
when, and the console output.
These logs never expire.
