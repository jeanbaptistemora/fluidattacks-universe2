[Key rotation](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/list/130/)
is essential when dealing with sensitive data.
The best way to prevent a key leakage
is by changing the keys regularly.
Our rotation cycles are as follows:

- **KMS keys:** every year or before in case it is needed.

- **JWT Tokens:** daily.

- **Digital Certificates:** every three months.

- **IAM passphrases:** [every three months](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/list/089/).

Rotations are done in these two different ways:

- **Automatic rotation:**
Some secrets are stored in secret vaults.
They are only accessible by administrators
and are rotated daily.
These secrets include JWT Tokens,
IAM passphrases,
and digital certificates.

- **Manual rotation:**
Some secrets are stored versioned
and encrypted in git repositories
using AES256 symmetric keys.
They are treated as code,
meaning that to be rotated a
[manual approval](https://fluidattacks.com/security/#PR)
needs to be obtained.
These secrets include KMS keys
and other application credentials.
