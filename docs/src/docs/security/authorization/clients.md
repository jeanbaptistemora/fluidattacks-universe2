Attack Surface Manager (ASM) has a set of
[roles](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/list/096/) that are necessary for every
hacking project. Once the client decides which members of their team should be
**project managers**, `Fluid Attacks` assigns the roles to them, providing them with the
[ability to assign](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/list/035/) the
[minimum required permissions](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/list/186/) to other
members of their team. Some of the available roles are *hacker*, *admin*, *releaser*,
*escaper*, *user* and *project manager*.
