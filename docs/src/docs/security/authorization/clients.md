Attack Surface Manager (ASM) has a set of
[roles](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/list/096/)
that are necessary for every hacking project.
Once the client decides
which members of their team should be **project managers**,
`Fluid Attacks` assigns the roles to them,
providing them with the
[ability to assign](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/list/035/) the
[minimum required permissions](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/list/186/)
to other members of their team.
Some of the available roles are *hacker*, *admin*,
*releaser*, *escaper*, *user* and *project manager*.
