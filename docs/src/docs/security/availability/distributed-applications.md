ASM is hosted in an application cluster
with autoscaling policies
and distributed replicas.
This ensures high availability,
as there is always one instance ready
to receive user requests
if another stops working.
Every cluster node has at least one
ASM instance running in it.
Additionally,
its front side is served via a region-distributed
[CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network),
providing maximum speed
and availability across the globe.
