As data is likely our most valuable asset,
we have strong backup policies for everything,
for example:

- Our redundant data centers are fully versioned,
meaning that any file can be recovered
or returned to a previous version.

- [Attack Surface Manager’s (ASM)](https://app.fluidattacks.com/)
database has daily, weekly, quarterly,
and annual full backup schedules.
The daily backups last one week,
the weekly ones twelve weeks,
the quarterly ones three years,
and the annual ones fifteen years.

- [Attack Surface Manager’s (ASM)](https://app.fluidattacks.com/)
database has point-in-time recovery
with the ability to recover the database
to the state it was in at a specific date and time
(hours, minutes and seconds)
during the last 35 days.

- All the exploits are versioned.
