As data is likely our most valuable asset, we have strong backup policies for everything,
for example:

- Our redundant data centers are fully versioned, meaning that any file can be recovered
or returned to a previous version.

- ASM’s database has daily, weekly, quarterly, and annual full backup schedules.
The daily backups last one week, the weekly ones twelve weeks, the quarterly ones three years,
and the annual ones fifteen years.

- ASM’s database has point-in-time recovery with the ability to recover the database to the
state it was in at a specific date and time (hours, minutes and seconds) during the last 35 days.

- All the exploits are versioned.
