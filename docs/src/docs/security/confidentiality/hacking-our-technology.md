We have projects focused
on hacking our own software.
For us,
it is essential to set an example
of secure software,
which is why today our entire technology stack
goes through a process of comprehensive
[Continuous Hacking](https://fluidattacks.com/services/continuous-hacking/).

All our development projects run
[Continuous Integration](https://fluidattacks.com/security/#CI) pipelines,
including exploits and strict linters,
to ensure that
[no known vulnerabilities](/criteria/source/155)
are released to production.
