We have projects focused on hacking our software. For us, it is essential to set an example
of secure software, which is why today our entire technology stack goes through a process
of comprehensive [Continuous Hacking](https://fluidattacks.com/services/continuous-hacking/).

All our development projects run [Continuous Integration](https://fluidattacks.com/security/#CI)
pipelines, including exploits and strict linters, to ensure that
[no known vulnerabilities](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/list/155/) are released to production.
