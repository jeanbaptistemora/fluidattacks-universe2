All our infrastructure is decentralized, meaning that we have independent data centers spread
across multiple regions. No hardware maintenance is needed as it is done by a third party.
No local networks are used. We only use Wifi connections with
[strong random generated passwords](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/list/253/) and with
the sole purpose of accessing the Internet. Connections are always encrypted
[using WPA2-AES](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/list/252/).
