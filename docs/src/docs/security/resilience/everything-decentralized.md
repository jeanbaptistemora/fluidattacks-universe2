All our infrastructure is decentralized,
meaning that we have independent data centers
spread across multiple regions.
No hardware maintenance is needed
as it is done by a third party.
No local networks are used.
We only use Wifi connections with
[strong random generated passwords](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/list/253/)
and with the sole purpose of accessing the Internet.
Connections are always encrypted
[using WPA2-AES](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/list/252/).
