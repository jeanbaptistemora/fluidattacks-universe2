[BYOD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_your_own_device)
is not allowed.
Every employee receives a computer
with a password-secured BIOS,
[TPM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/tpm/trusted-platform-module-overview)
hardware, and
[biometric fingerprint reader](/criteria/authentication/231).
Going to the office is the rule,
but employees can always fill out an exception form
to telework in case they need to.
In case our offices close (e.g., due to
[COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) pandemic),
everyone can still do their job seamlessly.
