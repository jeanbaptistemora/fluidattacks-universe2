In order to have a direct communication channel with our clients
and keeping them informed regarding any doubt,
we support an email ticket system (help@fluidattacks.com).
Tickets are treated as confidential information and only
support engineers within Fluid Attacks can see them.

Any type of concern or request can be sent and our engineers will get
in touch within the next twenty-four hours.
