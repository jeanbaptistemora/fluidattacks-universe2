We continuously monitor our main systems:

- [Attack Surface Manager (ASM)](https://app.fluidattacks.com/).
- [GraphQL API](https://app.fluidattacks.com/api).
- [Our website](https://fluidattacks.com/).

By doing so,
We allow all interested parties,
including our own developers,
to know the availability status of such systems.
Monitoring checks run on North American
and European servers every minute for all applications.
This information is real-time
and available on our
[Status Site](https://status.fluidattacks.com/).
