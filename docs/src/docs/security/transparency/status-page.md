We continuously monitor our Attack Surface Manager (ASM), its API, and
[our website](https://fluidattacks.com/). Monitoring checks run on North American and
European servers every minute for all applications. They send HTTP GET requests,
and this information is real-time and available on our
[Status Site](https://status.fluidattacks.com/).
