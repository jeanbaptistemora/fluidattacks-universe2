We continuously monitor our
Attack Surface Manager (ASM), its API, and
[our website](https://fluidattacks.com/).
Monitoring checks run on North American
and European servers every minute for all applications.
They send HTTP GET requests,
and this information is real-time
and available on our
[Status Site](https://status.fluidattacks.com/).
