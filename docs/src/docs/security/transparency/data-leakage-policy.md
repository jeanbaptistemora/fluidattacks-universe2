In cases where `Fluid Attacks` detects a breach, emails are sent to notify the involved parties.
These emails contain information on what data was leaked or compromised, when,
and for how long (to the extent that this information is available). For a breach that exposes
private data of a large number of users, the public will also be informed via email.
