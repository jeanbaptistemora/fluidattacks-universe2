In cases where `Fluid Attacks` detects a breach,
emails are sent to notify the involved parties.
These emails contain information
on what data was leaked or compromised,
when, and for how long
(to the extent that this information is available).
For a breach that exposes private data
of a large number of users,
the public will also be informed via email.
