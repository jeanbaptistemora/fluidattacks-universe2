As a security company,
`Fluid Attacks` is aware of the importance of

- having honesty, teamwork,
and discipline as immovable principles
(our full manifest can be found
[here](https://fluidattacks.com/about-us/values/));

- developing products
that comply with the highest worldwide
[security standards](/criteria/);

- acquiring only
[compliant services and products for internal use](/criteria/authentication/226);

- implementing best security practices
within our organization;

- being completely transparent with our clients,
especially regarding their data:
[how we use it, and what we do to protect it](/criteria/privacy/315).

These principles,
conceived since the early days of the company,
have allowed us to implement
a large number of measures throughout the years.
On this page,
we will mention those
that provide the highest value
to our customers in terms of security.
