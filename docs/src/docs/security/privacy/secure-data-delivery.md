Here is what we do to reduce information leakage
when delivering data to the client.

## Secure information sharing system
We use an information-sharing system with
[DLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_loss_prevention_software)
when sending any sensitive information to our clients.
This includes contracts, portfolios,
and other sensitive documents.

## Signed URLs
[Attack Surface Manager (ASM)](https://app.fluidattacks.com/)
has the feature of creating
signed download URLs with an expiration date
when downloading reports,
meaning that links expire
and can only be used by the user
who requested the download.

## Onion Routing
The [Fluid Attacks](https://fluidattacks.com/)
domain supports
[Onion Routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_routing),
improving privacy of the users
and enabling more fine-grained protection.

## Passphrase protected reports
All reports downloaded via
[Attack Surface Manager (ASM)](https://app.fluidattacks.com/)
have a randomly generated four-word passphrase.
This passphrase is sent to the email
of the user who requested the download.
This applies to both XLS and PDF formats.

## Watermarked reports
Every report downloaded via
[Attack Surface Manager (ASM)](https://app.fluidattacks.com/)
comes with a watermark on all its pages,
specifying that only the individual who generated it
is allowed to read it.
This is used as a measure to identify
who generated the report in the first place
and discourage its distribution
through channels other than
[Attack Surface Manager (ASM)](https://app.fluidattacks.com/).
