To be respectful to users regarding what information they want to receive,
for all commercial and informative emails, recipients can stop getting them by clicking on the
**"unsubscribe from this list"** link. By doing so, their emails are placed on a list of
unsubscribed emails, and no new emails will be sent to them.
