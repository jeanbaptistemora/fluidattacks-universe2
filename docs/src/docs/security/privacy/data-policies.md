The following policies apply
to all the information provided
by a client in a project context.

## Data use policy
We are committed to using our clients' data
exclusively for vulnerability scanning
in the context of the service we are providing.
No other activities will be executed
over the provided information.

## Data retention policy
All the data related to a project
can be deleted from our
[Attack Surface Manager (ASM)](https://app.fluidattacks.com/)
by a user with a ***project manager role***.
Once this action is performed,
a 30-day
[deletion window](/criteria/privacy/317)
begins.
Any ***project manager*** can undo the deletion action.
After the 30-day waiting period,
the project source code, secrets,
metadata and other project-related
[data are completely removed](/criteria/data/183)
from all our systems.
