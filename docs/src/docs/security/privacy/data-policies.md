The following policies apply to all the information provided by a client in a project context.

## Data use policy
We are committed to using our clients' data exclusively for vulnerability scanning in the
context of the service we are providing. No other activities will be executed over the
provided information.

## Data retention policy
All the data related to a project can be deleted from our Attack Surface Manager (ASM) by a
user with a ***project manager role***. Once this action is performed, a 30-day
[deletion window](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/list/317/) begins.
Any ***project manager*** can undo the deletion action. After the 30-day waiting period,
the project source code, secrets, metadata and other project-related
[data are completely removed](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/list/183/)
from all our systems.
