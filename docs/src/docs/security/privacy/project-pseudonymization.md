Every project has a pseudonym within our systems,
which brings advantages such as the following:

- Employees without direct access to the project
do not know the client’s name
or any other information that can help them to
[connect the project with the client](/criteria/privacy/313).

- Internal analytics charts and other documents
never use the client’s name;
they use the project’s pseudonym.

Generally speaking,
only the people who need to know who the client of a project is,
are the people who actually know it.
