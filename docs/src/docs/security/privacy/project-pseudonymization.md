Every project has a pseudonym within our systems, which brings advantages such as the following:

- Employees without direct access to the project do not know the client’s name or any other
information that can help them to
[connect the project with the client](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/list/313/).

- Internal analytics charts and other documents never use the client’s name;
they use the project’s pseudonym.

Generally speaking, only the people who need to know who the client of a project is,
are the people who actually know it.
