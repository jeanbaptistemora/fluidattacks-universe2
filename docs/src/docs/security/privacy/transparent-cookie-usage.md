Both ASM and [Web](https://fluidattacks.com/) use a
[GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) module that

- informs the user about every cookie the site creates; and

- lets users specify which ones to allow, thus giving them full control over what information
we are creating and manipulating within their browser.

By doing this, we become compliant with security rules such as the following:

- [Request user consent](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/list/310/)

- [Allow user consent revocation](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/list/312/)

- [Provide processed data information](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/list/315/)
