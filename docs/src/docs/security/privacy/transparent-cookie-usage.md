Both ASM and [Web](https://fluidattacks.com/) use a
[GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation)
module that

- informs the user about every cookie the site creates; and

- lets users specify which ones to allow,
thus giving them full control
over what information we are creating
and manipulating within their browser.

By doing this,
we become compliant with security rules
such as the following:

- [Request user consent](/criteria/privacy/310)

- [Allow user consent revocation](/criteria/privacy/312)

- [Provide processed data information](/criteria/privacy/315)
