Regarding a field as critical as cybersecurity,
it is always best to be aware of the ideal conditions
for keeping systems as secure as possible
and the difficulties associated with non-compliance.
At `Fluid Attacks`, we recognize this,
which is why we are committed to sharing our knowledge on the topic
with our clients and the community.
Using a reasonable and meticulous method,
we have been building this block of information over the years
and have compiled it into three categories,
which we present in this section of our documentation,
called **Criteria**.

In the first part,
we exhibit an ever-evolving list of vulnerabilities,
grouped according to [CAPEC](https://capec.mitre.org/)
(Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification),
which supports our security assessments and analysis as a red team.
In the second part,
we present a list of security requirements
that guide and determine the rigor of our tests.
And finally, we offer a list
in which we reference all the international security standards
that we have filtered and condensed
to construct our summary of requirements.
