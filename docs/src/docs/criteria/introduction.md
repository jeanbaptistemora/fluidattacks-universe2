Regarding a field as critical as cybersecurity,
it is always best to be aware of the conditions
for keeping systems as secure as possible
and the difficulties associated with non-compliance.
At `Fluid Attacks`, we recognize this,
which is why we are committed to contributing related knowledge
to our clients and the community.
With a reasonable and meticulous method,
we have been building this block of information over the years
in the form of three categories
that we compile and present in this section of our documentation,
called **Criteria**.

We exhibit an ever-evolving list of vulnerabilities in the first part,
grouped according to [CAPEC](https://capec.mitre.org/)
(Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification),
which supports our security assessments and analysis as a red team.
In the second part,
we present a list of security requirements
that guide and determine the rigor of our tests.
And finally, we offer a list
in which we reference all the international security standards
that we have filtered and condensed to construct our list of requirements.
