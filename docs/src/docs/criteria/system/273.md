## Requirement

All the workstations in production
must have an unalterable security suite
(Anti-virus, *Antispyware*, *Host Firewall*, *Host-IDS*, *Host-IPS*).

## Findings

- [F077. ARP spoofing](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/077/)

- [F084. MDNS spoofing](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/084/)

- [F104. USB flash drive attacks](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/104/)

- [F115. Security controls bypass](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/115/)

Automated code review is used to identify dangerous code written by malicious
in-house developers or outsource providers.

An adversary engages in probing and exploration activities to identify
constituents and properties of the target.

- [CAPEC-442: Infected Software:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/442.html)
An adversary adds malicious logic, often in the form of a computer virus,
to otherwise benign software.
Many times, the malicious logic is inserted into empty space between legitimate
code,
and is then called when the software is executed.

An adversary installs and executes malicious code on the target system in an
effort to achieve a negative technical impact.

Utilize centrally managed anti-malware software to continuously monitor and
defend each of the organization’s workstations and servers.

- [CIS Controls. 9.4 Apply Host-Based Firewalls or Port-Filtering:](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/)
Apply host-based firewalls or port-filtering tools on end systems,
with a default-deny rule that drops all traffic except those services and ports
that are explicitly allowed.

- [CIS Controls. 9.5 Implement Application Firewalls:](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/)
Place application firewalls in front of any critical servers to verify and
validate the traffic going to the server.
Any unauthorized traffic should be blocked and logged.

- [CIS Controls. 14.2 Enable Firewall Filtering Between VLANs:](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/)
Enable firewall filtering between *VLANs* to ensure that only authorized
systems are able to communicate with other systems necessary to fulfill their
specific responsibilities.

The software establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for
privileged or protected operations,
but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct
endpoint.

Each Responsible Entity shall implement,
except under CIP Exceptional Circumstances,
one or more plan(s) to achieve the objective of mitigating the risk of the
introduction of malicious code to low impact BES Cyber Systems.
The plan(s) shall include antivirus software,
