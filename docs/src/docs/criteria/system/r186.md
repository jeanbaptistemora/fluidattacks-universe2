## Requirement

The principle of least privilege must be applied when creating new objects and
roles, setting access permissions, and accessing other systems.

## Description

Systems should have a set of roles with different levels
of privilege to access resources.
Users and applications should always have a role with the minimum level of
privilege required to execute their functions.
A violation of this may become a new vulnerability or leverage for causing a
greater impact when exploiting other vulnerabilities.

## Findings

- [F031. Excessive privileges](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/031/)

- [F101. Lack of protection against deletion](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/101/)

- [CAPEC-17: Using Malicious Files:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/17.html)
An attack of this type exploits a system's configuration that allows an
attacker to either directly access an executable file,
for example through shell access;
or in a possible worst case allows an attacker to upload a file and then
execute it.

- [CAPEC-23: File Content Injection:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html)
An attack of this type exploits the host's trust in executing remote content,
including binary files.
The files are poisoned with a malicious payload
(targeting the file systems accessible by the target software)
by the adversary and may be passed through standard channels such as via email,
and standard web content like PDF and multimedia files.

- [CAPEC-27: Leveraging Race Conditions via Symbolic Links:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/27.html)
This attack leverages the use of symbolic links (Symlinks) in order to write to
sensitive files.
An attacker can create a Symlink link to a target file not otherwise accessible
to them.
When the privileged program tries to create a temporary file with the same name
as the Symlink link,
it will actually write to the target file pointed to by the attackers' Symlink
link.

- [CAPEC-35: Leverage Executable Code in Non-Executable Files:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/35.html)
An attack of this type exploits a system's trust in configuration and resource
files.
When the executable loads the resource
(such as an image file or configuration file)
the attacker has modified the file to either execute malicious code directly or
manipulate the target process (e.g., application server) to execute based on the
malicious configuration parameters.

- [CAPEC-122: Privilege Abuse:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html)
An adversary is able to exploit features of the target that should be reserved
for privileged users or administrators but are exposed to use by lower or
non-privileged accounts.
Access to sensitive information and functionality must be controlled to ensure
that only authorized users are able to access these resources.

- [CAPEC-153: Input Data Manipulation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/153.html)
An attacker exploits a weakness in input validation by controlling the format,
structure, and composition of data to an input-processing interface.
By supplying input of a non-standard or unexpected form an attacker can
adversely impact the security of the target.

- [CAPEC-176: Configuration/Environment Manipulation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/176.html)
An attacker manipulates files or settings external to a target application
which affect the behavior of that application.

- [CAPEC-233: Privilege Escalation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/233.html)
An adversary exploits a weakness enabling them to elevate their privilege and
perform an action that they are not supposed to be authorized to perform.

Limit access to scripting tools (such as **Microsoft® PowerShell** and
*Python*) to only administrative or development users with the need to access
those capabilities.

- [CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/250.html)
The software performs an operation at a privilege level that is higher than the
minimum level required,
which creates new weaknesses or amplifies the consequences of other weaknesses.

- [CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/269.html)
The software does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for
an actor,
creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

- [CWE-272: Least Privilege Violation:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/272.html)
The elevated privilege level required to perform operations such as *chroot()*
should be dropped immediately after the operation is performed.

- [CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html)
The product, upon installation, sets incorrect permissions for an object that
exposes it to an unintended actor.

- [CWE-285: Improper Authorization:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/285.html)
The software does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check
when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

- [CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/732.html)
The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way
that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.

which are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks
in accordance with organizational missions and business functions.

Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not
properly enforced.
Attackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionality and/or
data, such as access other users' accounts, view sensitive files,
modify other users' data, change access rights, etc.
