## Requirement

The principle of least privilege must be applied
when creating new objects and roles,
setting access permissions,
and accessing other systems.

## Description

Systems should have a set of roles
with different levels of privilege
to access resources.
Users and applications
should always have a role
with the minimum level of privilege required
to execute their functions.
A violation of this
may become a new vulnerability
or leverage for causing a greater impact
when exploiting other vulnerabilities.

## Types

- [031. Excessive privileges](/types/031)

- [101. Lack of protection against deletion](/types/101)

- [CAPEC-17: Using Malicious Files:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/17.html)
An attack of this type
exploits a system's configuration
that allows an attacker to either directly access an executable file,
for example through shell access;
or in a possible worst case allows an attacker
to upload a file and then execute it.

- [CAPEC-23: File Content Injection:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html)
An attack of this type
exploits the host's trust in executing remote content,
including binary files.
The files are poisoned with a malicious payload
(targeting the file systems accessible
by the target software)
by the adversary
and may be passed through standard channels
such as via email,
and standard web content like PDF
and multimedia files.

- [CAPEC-27: Leveraging Race Conditions via Symbolic Links:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/27.html)
This attack leverages the use of symbolic links (Symlinks)
in order to write to sensitive files.
An attacker
can create a Symlink link to a target file
not otherwise accessible to them.
When the privileged program
tries to create a temporary file
with the same name as the Symlink link,
it will actually write to the target file pointed to
by the attackers' Symlink link.

- [CAPEC-35: Leverage Executable Code in Non-Executable Files:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/35.html)
An attack of this type
exploits a system's trust in configuration
and resource files.
When the executable loads the resource
(such as an image file or configuration file)
the attacker has modified the file
to either execute malicious code directly
or manipulate the target process
(e.g., application server) to execute
based on the malicious configuration parameters.

- [CAPEC-122: Privilege Abuse:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html)
An adversary is able to exploit features
of the target
that should be reserved for privileged users
or administrators but are exposed to use
by lower or non-privileged accounts.
Access to sensitive information and functionality
must be controlled to ensure
that only authorized users
are able to access these resources.

- [CAPEC-153: Input Data Manipulation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/153.html)
An attacker exploits a weakness in input validation
by controlling the format,
structure, and composition of data
to an input-processing interface.
By supplying input of a non-standard
or unexpected form an attacker
can adversely impact the security of the target.

- [CAPEC-176: Configuration/Environment Manipulation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/176.html)
An attacker manipulates files
or settings external to a target application
which affect the behavior
of that application.

- [CAPEC-233: Privilege Escalation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/233.html)
An adversary exploits a weakness enabling them
to elevate their privilege
and perform an action
that they are not supposed to be authorized
to perform.

Limit access to scripting tools
(such as **MicrosoftÂ® PowerShell**
and *Python*) to only administrative
or development users with the need
to access those capabilities.

- [CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/250.html)
The software performs an operation at a privilege level
that is higher than the minimum level required,
which creates new weaknesses
or amplifies the consequences
of other weaknesses.

- [CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/269.html)
The software does not properly assign,
modify, track,
or check privileges for an actor,
creating an unintended sphere of control
for that actor.

- [CWE-272: Least Privilege Violation:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/272.html)
The elevated privilege level
required to perform operations
such as *chroot()*
should be dropped immediately after the operation
is performed.

- [CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html)
The product,
upon installation,
sets incorrect permissions for an object
that exposes it to an unintended actor.

- [CWE-285: Improper Authorization:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/285.html)
The software does not perform
or incorrectly performs an authorization check
when an actor attempts to access a resource
or perform an action.

- [CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/732.html)
The product specifies permissions
for a security-critical resource in a way
that allows that resource to be read
or modified by unintended actors.

employs the principle of least privilege,
allowing only authorized accesses for users
(or processes acting on behalf of users)
which are necessary
to accomplish assigned tasks in accordance
with organizational missions
and business functions.

Restrictions on what authenticated users
are allowed to do
are often not properly enforced.
Attackers can exploit these flaws
to access unauthorized functionality
and/or data,
such as access other users' accounts,
view sensitive files, modify other users' data,
change access rights, etc.
