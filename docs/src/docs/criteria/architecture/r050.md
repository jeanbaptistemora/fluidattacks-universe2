## Requirement

Interpreted code (e.g., *Javascript*, *CSS*) must be loaded from domains
controlled by the organization.

## Description

Applications often use resources or have dependencies that are hosted on
other servers.
These resources should be hosted on domains controlled by the organization
in order to prevent several types of injection attacks.

- [CAPEC-19: Embedding Scripts within Scripts:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/19.html)
An attack of this type exploits a programs' vulnerabilities that are brought on
by allowing remote hosts to execute scripts.
The adversary leverages this capability to execute their own script by
embedding it within other scripts that the target software is likely to
execute.
The adversary must have the ability to inject their script into a script that
is likely to be executed.

- [CAPEC-154: Resource Location Spoofing:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/154.html)
An adversary deceives an application or user and convinces them to request a
resource from an unintended location.
By spoofing the location, the adversary can cause an alternate resource to be
used,
often one that the adversary controls and can be used to help them achieve
their malicious goals.

- [CAPEC-175: Code Inclusion:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/175.html)
An adversary exploits a weakness on the target to force arbitrary code to be
retrieved locally or from a remote location and executed.

- [CAPEC-242: Code Injection:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/242.html)
An adversary exploits a weakness in input validation on the target to inject
new code into that which is currently executing.

- [CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/829.html)
The software imports, requires, or includes executable functionality
(such as a library) from a source that is outside of the intended control
sphere.

- [CWE-830: Inclusion of Web Functionality from an Untrusted Source:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/830.html)
The software includes web functionality (such as a web widget) from another
domain,
potentially granting total access and control of the software to the untrusted
source.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V5.3 Output encoding and Injection Prevention Requirements.(5.3.6):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify that the application projects against *JavaScript* or *JSON* injection
attacks,
including for eval attacks, remote *JavaScript* includes, *CSP* bypasses,
**DOM XSS**, and *JavaScript* expression evaluation.

- [OWASP Top 10 A1:2017-Injection:](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection)
Injection flaws, such as **SQL**, **NoSQL**, **OS**, and *LDAP* injection,
occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or
query.
The attacker's hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended
commands or accessing data without proper authorization.

Security misconfiguration is the most commonly seen issue.
This is commonly a result of insecure default configurations,
incomplete or ad hoc configurations, open cloud storage,
misconfigured *HTTP* headers,
and verbose error messages containing sensitive information.
Not only must all operating systems, frameworks, libraries, and applications be
securely configured, but they must be patched/upgraded in a timely fashion.

*XSS* flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web
page without proper validation or escaping,
or updates an existing web page with user-supplied data using a browser *API*
that can create *HTML* or **JavaScript**.
*XSS* allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim's browser which can
hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious
sites.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V10.3 Deployed Application Integrity Controls.(10.3.2):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
The application must not load or execute code from untrusted sources,
such as loading includes, modules, plugins, code, or libraries from untrusted
sources or the Internet.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V10.3 Deployed Application Integrity Controls.(10.3.3):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify that the application has protection from sub-domain takeovers if the
application relies upon *DNS* entries or *DNS* sub-domains.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V12.3 File execution Requirements.(12.3.6):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify that the application does not include and execute functionality from
untrusted sources,
such as unverified content distribution networks, *JavaScript* libraries,
or **node npm** libraries.
