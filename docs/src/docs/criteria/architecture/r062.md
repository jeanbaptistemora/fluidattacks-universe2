## Requirement

The organization must define standard configurations that correct all known
vulnerabilities. These configurations must also be consistent
with industry standards.

## Description

System configuration is essential when it comes to security issues.
The system must follow the industry’s standard configurations that prevent all
known vulnerabilities. These settings also contribute to ensuring the ongoing
confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience
of systems and services.

Secure coding standards help the organization’s developers avoid the most
obvious bugs and provide ground rules for code review.

- [CAPEC-125: Flooding:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html)
An adversary consumes the resources of a target by rapidly engaging in a large
number of interactions with the target.
This type of attack generally exposes a weakness in rate limiting or flow.
When successful this attack prevents legitimate users from accessing the
service and can cause the target to crash.

- [CAPEC-130: Excessive Allocation:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/130.html)
An adversary causes the target to allocate excessive resources to servicing the
attackers' request, thereby reducing the resources available for legitimate
services and degrading or denying services.
Usually, this attack focuses on memory allocation, but any finite resource on
the target could be the attacked, including bandwidth, processing cycles,
or other resources.

- [CAPEC-151: Identity Spoofing:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/151.html)
Identity Spoofing refers to the action of assuming (i.e., taking on)
the identity of some other entity (human or non-human) and then using that
identity to accomplish a goal. An adversary may craft messages that appear
to come from a different principle or use stolen / spoofed authentication
credentials. Alternatively, an adversary may intercept a message from a
legitimate sender and attempt to make it look like the message comes from
them without changing its content.

- [CAPEC-161: Infrastructure Manipulation:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/161.html)
An attacker exploits characteristics of the infrastructure of a network entity
in order to perpetrate attacks or information gathering on network objects
or effect a change in the ordinary information flow between network objects.

Many older or poorly configured **XML** processors evaluate external entity
references within **XML** documents. External entities can be used to disclose
internal files using the file **URI** handler, internal file shares,
internal port scanning, remote code execution, and denial of service attacks.

Security misconfiguration is the most commonly seen issue.
This is commonly a result of insecure default configurations, incomplete
or ad hoc configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured **HTTP** headers,
and verbose error messages containing sensitive information.
Not only must all operating systems, frameworks, libraries, and applications
be securely configured, but they must be patched/upgraded in a timely fashion.
