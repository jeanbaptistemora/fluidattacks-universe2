## Requirement

Redirects must be controlled, especially when they depend on external input.

## Description

Systems must guarantee that all redirects lead to a controlled or trusted site.
In general, redirects based on input data should be avoided as they could
enable phishing attacks. If they are required, they should be controlled so
that users are only redirected to trusted sites.

## Findings

- [023. Uncontrolled external site redirect](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/023/)

- [097. Reverse tabnabbing](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/097/)

- [100. Server-side request forgery (SSRF)](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/100/)

An attacker exploits characteristics of the infrastructure of a network entity
in order to perpetrate attacks or information gathering on network objects or
effect a change in the ordinary information flow between network objects.

A web application accepts a user-controlled input that specifies a link to an
external site, and uses that link in a Redirect.
This simplifies **phishing** attacks.

The software is composed of a server that relies on the client to implement a

- [CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html)
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and
retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that
the request is being sent to the expected destination.

Verify that trusted enforcement points such as at access control gateways,
servers, and serverless functions enforce access controls.
Never enforce access controls on the client.

Verify that the application enforces access control rules on a trusted service
layer, especially if client-side access control is present and could
be bypassed.

or show a warning when redirecting to potentially untrusted content.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V5.2 Sanitization and Sandboxing Requirements.(5.2.6):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify that the application protects against **SSRF** attacks, by validating or
sanitizing untrusted data or **HTTP** file metadata, such as filenames and URL
input fields, or using whitelisting of protocols, domains, paths and ports.

resources or systems to which the server can send requests or load
data/files from.
