## Requirement

The response time with the maximum expected concurrence must be no more
than 5 seconds.

## Description

Response time is a relevant measure of a system’s availability and
adaptability to stress. It is also important when it comes to
usability and reliance. For these reasons, the response time must not
surpass 5 seconds when the number of concurrent users reaches its peak.

- [CAPEC-125: Flooding:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html)
An adversary consumes the resources of a target by rapidly engaging in a large
number of interactions with the target.
This type of attack generally exposes a weakness in rate limiting or flow.
When successful this attack prevents legitimate users from accessing the
service and can cause the target to crash.

- [CAPEC-130: Excessive Allocation:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/130.html)
An adversary causes the target to allocate excessive resources to servicing the
attackers' request, thereby reducing the resources available for legitimate
services and degrading or denying services. Usually, this attack focuses on
memory allocation, but any finite resource on the target could be the attacked,
including bandwidth, processing cycles, or other resources.

- [CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)
The software does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a
limited resource thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources
consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.

- [CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html)
The software allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of
an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources
that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy
for that actor.

The controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and
organizational measures to ensure an appropriate level of security, including
the the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a
timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident.

Verify the application has sufficient anti-automation controls to detect and
protect against data exfiltration, excessive business logic requests, excessive
file uploads or denial of service attacks.

Verify that query whitelisting or a combination of depth limiting and amount
limiting should be used to prevent **GraphQL** or data layer expression denial
of service (**DoS**) as a result of expensive, nested queries.
For more advanced scenarios, query cost analysis should be used.
