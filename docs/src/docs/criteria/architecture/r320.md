## Requirement

The system must enforce access controls on trusted enforcement points,
which are not on the client’s side.

## Description

Systems must enforce access controls on trusted enforcement points,
such as access control gateways, severs and serverless functions.
Client-side access control enforcement cannot be trusted because it is prone
to being bypassed and/or tampered with.

- [CAPEC-11: Cause Web Server Misclassification:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/11.html)
An attack of this type exploits a Web server’s decision to take action based
on filename or file extension.
Because different file types are handled by different server processes,
misclassification may force the Web server to take unexpected action,
or expected actions in an unexpected sequence.

- [CAPEC-22: Exploiting Trust in Client:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)
An attack of this type exploits vulnerabilities in client/server communication
channel authentication and data integrity. It leverages the implicit trust a
server places in the client, or more importantly, that which the server
believes is the client.

- [CAPEC-28: Fuzzing:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/28.html)
In this attack pattern, the adversary leverages fuzzing to try to
identify weaknesses in the system.
Fuzzing is a software security and functionality testing method that feeds
randomly constructed input to the system and looks for an indication that a
failure in response to that input has occurred.

- [CAPEC-34: HTTP Response Splitting:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/34.html)
This attack uses a maliciously-crafted **HTTP** request in order to cause a
vulnerable web server to respond with an **HTTP** response stream that will be
interpreted by the client as two separate responses instead of one.
This is possible when user-controlled input is used unvalidated as part of the
response headers.

- [CAPEC-39: Manipulating Opaque Client-based Data Tokens:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/39.html)
In circumstances where an application holds important data client-side in
tokens (cookies, **URL**s, data files, and so forth) that data can be
manipulated. If client or server-side application components reinterpret that
data as authentication tokens or data (such as store item pricing or wallet
information) then even opaquely manipulating that data may bear fruit
for an Attacker.

- [CAPEC-153: Input Data Manipulation:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/153.html)
An attacker exploits a weakness in input validation by controlling the format,
structure, and composition of data to an input-processing interface.
By supplying input of a non-standard or unexpected form an attacker can
adversely impact the security of the target.

- [CWE-284: Improper Access Control:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)
The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource
from an unauthorized actor.

- [CWE-285: Improper Authorization:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/285.html)
The software does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check
when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

- [CWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/602.html)
The software is composed of a server that relies on the client to implement a
mechanism that is intended to protect the server.

- [CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/639.html)
The system’s authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining
access to another user’s data or record by modifying the key value identifying
the data.

Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly, allowing attackers to compromise passwords,
keys, or session tokens, or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume
other users' identities temporarily or permanently.

Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not
properly enforced. Attackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized
functionality and/or data, such as access other users' accounts,
view sensitive files, modify other users' data, change access rights, etc.
