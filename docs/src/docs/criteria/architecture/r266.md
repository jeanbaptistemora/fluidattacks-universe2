## Requirement

The organization must disable or carefully control the insecure functions of a
system (system hardening).

## Description

Sometimes platforms include functionalities that are not required or could be
harmful for some applications built on top of or residing in them. Other times,
applications are developed including functionalities that allow actions that
could be considered insecure. All these functionalities should be disabled or
otherwise controlled to prevent them from compromising the system’s security.
Furthermore, the system must enforce those controls on trusted enforcement
points such as access control gateways, severs and serverless functions.

An attacker exploits characteristics of the infrastructure of a network entity
in order to perpetrate attacks or information gathering on network objects or
effect a change in the ordinary information flow between network objects.

An adversary leverages a legitimate capability of an application in such a way
as to achieve a negative technical impact. The system functionality is not
altered or modified but used in a way that was not intended.

The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource

The software is composed of a server that relies on the client to implement a
mechanism that is intended to protect the server.

- [CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/749.html)
The software provides an Applications Programming Interface (API) or similar
interface for interaction with external actors, but the interface includes a
dangerous method or function that is not properly restricted.

Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not
properly enforced. Attackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized
functionality and/or data, such as access other users' accounts, view sensitive
files, modify other users' data, change access rights, etc.

Security misconfiguration is the most commonly seen issue. This is commonly a
result of insecure default configurations, incomplete or ad hoc configurations,
open cloud storage, misconfigured **HTTP** headers, and verbose error messages
containing sensitive information. Not only must all operating systems,
frameworks, libraries, and applications be securely configured, but they must
be patched/upgraded in a timely fashion.

serial variants are disabled or protected by a complex password.

safe equivalent functions.

be bypassed.

(i.e., **PKCS#1** v1.5, etc.), ciphers with small block sizes
(i.e., **Triple-DES**, **Blowfish**, etc.), and weak hashing algorithms
(i.e., **MD5**, **SHA1**, etc.) are not used unless required for backwards
compatibility.
