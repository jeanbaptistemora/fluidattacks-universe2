## Requirement

The system must not allow parameter inclusion
in directory names or file paths.

## Description

A system must not allow the inclusion of directory names
or files paths in its parameters.
By tampering the fields associated with these parameters,
an attacker may access those paths
and compromise sensitive information.

## Implementation

It must be assumed that all data inputs are malicious,
so whitelisting and escaping should be used
to discard any type of data input that is not acceptable
(i.e., does not strictly comply with the specifications) or sanitize it.

## Attacks

1. An attacker may create or overwrite critical files
used to execute code, such as programs or libraries.
If the target file is used as a security mechanism,
then the attacker may surpass that mechanism.
This can be done, for example, by adding a new account
at the end of a password file to bypass the authentication process.

2. An attacker may read the content of unexpected files
and expose sensitive information.
If the target file is used as a security mechanism,
then the attacker may surpass that mechanism.
For example, by reading a password file,
the attacker may perform a brute force attack
to obtain valid user credentials.

3. The attacker may overwrite, delete or corrupt critical files,
such as programs, libraries or sensitive information.
This may lead to a system failure,
and in cases where there are authentication mechanisms,
the attacker may block the system access to all users.

- [CAPEC-11: Cause Web Server Misclassification:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/11.html)
An attack of this type exploits a Web server's decision to take action based on
filename or file extension.
Because different file types are handled by different server processes,
misclassification may force the Web server to take unexpected action,
or expected actions in an unexpected sequence.

- [CAPEC-153: Input Data Manipulation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/153.html)
An attacker exploits a weakness in input validation by controlling the format,
structure, and composition of data to an input-processing interface.
By supplying input of a non-standard or unexpected form an attacker can
adversely impact the security of the target.

- [CAPEC-165: File Manipulation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/165.html)
An attacker modifies file contents or attributes (such as extensions or names)
of files in a manner to cause incorrect processing by an application.

An adversary exploits a weakness on the target to force arbitrary code to be
retrieved locally or from a remote location and executed.

- [CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path traversal'):](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)
The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to
identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent
directory,
but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the
pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside
of the restricted directory.

- [CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html)
The software uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within
a restricted directory,
but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ""**..**" that can resolve
to a location that is outside of that directory.

- [CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/36.html)
The software uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within
a restricted directory,
but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as
**"/abs/path"** that can resolve to a location that is outside of that
directory.

- [CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/73.html)
The software allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that
are used in filesystem operations.

- [CWE-98: PHP Remote File Inclusion:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/98.html)
The PHP application receives input from an upstream component,
but it does not restrict or incorrectly restricts the input before its usage in
"**require**," "**include**," or similar functions.

- [CWE-641: Improper Restriction of Names for Files and Other Resources:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/641.html)
The application constructs the name of a file or other resource using input
from an upstream component,
but it does not restrict or incorrectly restricts the resulting name.

Injection flaws, such as **SQL**, **NoSQL**, **OS**, and *LDAP* injection,
occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or
query.
The attacker's hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended
commands or accessing data without proper authorization.

Many web applications and **API**s do not properly protect sensitive data,
such as financial, healthcare, and *PII*.
Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit card
fraud, identity theft, or other crimes.
Sensitive data may be compromised without extra protection,
such as encryption at rest or in transit, and requires special precautions when
exchanged with the browser.
