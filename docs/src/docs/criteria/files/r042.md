An attacker modifies file contents
or attributes (such as extensions or names)
of files in a manner to cause incorrect processing
by an application.

- [CWE-646: Reliance on File Name or Extension of Externally-Supplied File:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/646.html)
The software allows a file to be uploaded,
but it relies on the file name
or extension of the file
to determine the appropriate behaviors.
This could be used by attackers
to cause the file to be misclassified
and processed in a dangerous fashion.

Verify that files obtained
from untrusted sources
are validated to be of expected type
based on the file's content.
