## Requirement

The application must not expose sensitive information in sections
that are publicly accessible.

## Description

Some applications have sections such as web pages and endpoints that are
publicly exposed or do not require an initiated session to be accessed.
These sections should contain neither sensitive corporate information nor
users' or employees' personal data.
Furthermore, corporate sensitive information should not be exposed on personal
social network accounts either.

## Types

An adversary actively probes the target in a manner that is designed to solicit
information that could be leveraged for malicious purposes.
This is achieved by exploring the target via ordinary interactions for the
purpose of gathering intelligence about the target,
or by sending data that is syntactically invalid or non-standard in an attempt
to produce a response that contains the desired data.

Many web applications and **API**s do not properly protect sensitive data,
such as financial, healthcare, and *PII*.
Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit card
fraud, identity theft, or other crimes.
Sensitive data may be compromised without extra protection,
such as encryption at rest or in transit, and requires special precautions when
exchanged with the browser.

Verify that directory browsing is disabled unless deliberately desired.
Additionally, applications should not allow discovery or disclosure of file or
directory metadata,
such as Thumbs.db, .DS_Store, .git or .svn folders.
