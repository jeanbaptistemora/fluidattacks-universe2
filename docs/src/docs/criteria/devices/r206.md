The system must keep mobile devices' communication protocols hidden,
protected with credentials or turned off.
This refers to protocols that allow data exchange such as `Bluetooth`, `NFC`
and `Tethering`.

Security misconfiguration is the most commonly seen issue.
This is commonly a result of insecure default configurations,
incomplete or ad hoc configurations, open cloud storage,
misconfigured *HTTP* headers,
and verbose error messages containing sensitive information.
Not only must all operating systems, frameworks, libraries, and applications be
securely configured, but they must be patched/upgraded in a timely fashion.
