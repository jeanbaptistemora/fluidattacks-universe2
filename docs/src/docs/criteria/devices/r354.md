## Requirement

Devices should have mechanisms that protect their firmware (anti-rollback)
from being downgraded.

## References

- [CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/693.html)
The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that
provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product.

- [Algorithm Downgrade:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/757.html)
A protocol or its implementation supports interaction between multiple actors
and allows those actors to negotiate which algorithm should be used as a
protection mechanism such as encryption or authentication, but it does not
select the strongest algorithm that is available to both parties.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 Appendix C: Internet of Things Verification Requirements.(C.22):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify that the device cannot be downgraded to old versions (anti-rollback)
of valid firmware.
