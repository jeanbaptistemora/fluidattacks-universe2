The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that
provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product.

- [CWE-1233: Improper Hardware Lock Protection for Security Sensitive Controls:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1233.html)
The product implements a register lock bit protection feature that permits
security sensitive controls to modify the protected configuration.

Security misconfiguration is the most commonly seen issue.
This is commonly a result of insecure default configurations, incomplete or
ad hoc configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured **HTTP** headers,
and verbose error messages containing sensitive information.
Not only must all operating systems, frameworks, libraries, and applications
be securely configured, but they must be patched/upgraded in a timely fashion.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 Appendix C: Internet of Things Verification Requirements.(C.3):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify that memory protection controls such as **ASLR** and **DEP** are enabled
by the embedded/**IoT** operating system, if applicable.
