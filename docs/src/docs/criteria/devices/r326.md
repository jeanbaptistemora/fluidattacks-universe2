## Requirement

Mobile applications must check whether the device on which they will run
is rooted.

## Description

Rooting is a process that grants mobile device users privileged control over
the device’s system. Applications running on such devices are susceptible to
technical information leaks (database connection strings, source code,
certificates, etc.). Therefore, applications must check whether the device is
rooted and inform the user about the associated risks,
or prevent its own execution.

## Types

- [048. Lack of root detection](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/048/)

The software performs an operation at a privilege level that is higher than the
minimum level required, which creates new weaknesses or amplifies the
consequences of other weaknesses.
