## Requirement

The system must restrict access to system functions
that execute critical business processes,
allowing only authorized users.

## Description

Systems must enforce access controls on trusted enforcement points.
They must also have a clear definition of user privileges and roles.
Functions that execute critical business processes should only be available for
authenticated users with roles that have the required privileges.

## Types

- [004. Remote command execution](/types/004)

- [032. Spoofing](/types/032)

- [039. Improper authorization control for web services](/types/039)

- [056. Anonymous connection](/types/056)

non-privileged accounts.
Access to sensitive information and functionality must be controlled to ensure
that only authorized users are able to access these resources.

Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not
properly enforced.
Attackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionality and/or
data, such as access other users' accounts, view sensitive files,
modify other users' data, change access rights, etc.

Verify enforcement of the principle of least privilege in functions, data
files, URLs, controllers, services, and other resources.
This implies protection against spoofing and elevation of privilege.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V1.4 Access Control Architectural Requirements.(1.4.4):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify the application uses a single and well-vetted access control mechanism
for accessing protected data and resources.
All requests must pass through this single mechanism to avoid copy and paste or
insecure alternative paths.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V1.4 Access Control Architectural Requirements.(1.4.5):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify that attribute or feature-based access control is used whereby the code
checks the user's authorization for a feature/data item rather than just their
role.
Permissions should still be allocated using roles.
