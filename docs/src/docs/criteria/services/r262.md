## Requirement

The system must use stable, tested
and up-to-date versions of third-party components.

## Description

1. The organization must ensure that the version of all of its products
and the products provided by third-parties
is up to date, stable and tested.
This reduces the risk of including vulnerabilities
reported in previous versions.

2. When a product changes its version,
the implemented improvements must be checked
to verify if there were fixes or new controls
related to recently discovered vulnerabilities.

## Implementation

1. Identify all the products that compose the technology stack,
including operating systems, versions, dependencies, and
logical and physical authentication features.
This inventory must be constantly updated.

2. Monitor the security of all identified components in public databases,
implementing alerts when public vulnerabilities are disclosed
for the products used by the organization
and determining the affectation level
caused by the reported vulnerabilities.

3. Apply the necessary updates
taking into account the vulnerability type, the affected components
and its risk classification within the organization.

4. Define security policies for the used components,
requiring updated versions, specific software,
ethical hacking and product licenses.
Include internal policies to disable unused features
and update default settings
that may pose a risk to the organization.

## Attacks

- An attacker obtains technical information about a specific product.
If the service/software is out of date,
there could be public exploits
designed to attack known vulnerabilities
present in the in-use version of the product.

## Attributes

- Layer: Application layer
- Asset: Services and functions

Components, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules,
run with the same privileges as the application.
If a vulnerable component is exploited,
such an attack can facilitate serious data loss or server takeover.
Applications and **API**s using components with known vulnerabilities may
undermine application defenses and enable various attacks and impacts.
