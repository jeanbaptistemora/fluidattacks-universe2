Deny communications with known malicious or unused Internet IP addresses and
limit access only to trusted and necessary IP address ranges at each of the
organization’s network boundaries.

- [CIS Controls. 14.1 Segment the Network Based on Sensitivity:](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/)
Segment the network based on the label or classification level of the
information stored on the servers, locate all sensitive information on
separated Virtual Local Area Networks (**VLANs**).

The software establishes a communication channel to an endpoint for privileged
or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is
communicating with the correct endpoint.

Security misconfiguration is the most commonly seen issue.
This is commonly a result of insecure default configurations, incomplete
or ad hoc configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured **HTTP** headers,
and verbose error messages.

Verify the segregation of components of differing trust levels through
well-defined security controls, firewall rules, **API** gateways,
reverse proxies, cloud-based security groups, or similar mechanisms.

Restrict inbound and outbound traffic to that which is necessary for the
cardholder data environment, and specifically deny all other traffic.

Install perimeter firewalls between all wireless networks and the cardholder
data environment. Configure these firewalls to deny or, if traffic is
necessary for business purposes, permit only authorized traffic.

- [PCI DSS v3.2.1 - Requirement 1.3.1:](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI_DSS_v3-2-1.pdf)
Implement a **DMZ** to limit inbound traffic to only system components that
provide authorized publicly accessible services, protocols, and ports.

- [PCI DSS v3.2.1 - Requirement 1.3.2:](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI_DSS_v3-2-1.pdf)
Limit inbound Internet traffic to **IP** addresses within the **DMZ**.

- [PCI DSS v3.2.1 - Requirement 1.3.3:](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI_DSS_v3-2-1.pdf)
Implement anti-spoofing measures to detect and block forged source IP
addresses from entering the network.

- [PCI DSS v3.2.1 - Requirement 1.3.4:](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI_DSS_v3-2-1.pdf)
Do not allow unauthorized outbound traffic from the cardholder
data environment to the Internet.

- [PCI DSS v3.2.1 - Requirement 1.3.6:](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI_DSS_v3-2-1.pdf)
Place system components that store cardholder data (such as a database)
in an internal network zone, segregated from the **DMZ**
and other untrusted networks.
