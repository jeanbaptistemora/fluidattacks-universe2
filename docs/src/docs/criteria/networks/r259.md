Deny communications with known malicious
or unused Internet IP addresses
and limit access only to trusted
and necessary IP address ranges
at each of the organizationâ€™s network boundaries.

- [CIS Controls. 14.1 Segment the Network Based on Sensitivity:](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/)
Segment the network based on the label
or classification level
of the information stored on the servers,
locate all sensitive information
on separated Virtual Local Area Networks (**VLANs**).

The software establishes
a communication channel to an endpoint
for privileged or protected operations,
but it does not properly ensure
that it is communicating
with the correct endpoint.

Security misconfiguration
is the most commonly seen issue.
This is commonly a result
of insecure default configurations,
incomplete or ad hoc configurations,
open cloud storage,
misconfigured **HTTP** headers,
and verbose error messages.

Verify the segregation of components
of differing trust levels through
well-defined security controls,
firewall rules, **API** gateways,
reverse proxies,
cloud-based security groups,
or similar mechanisms.

Restrict inbound and outbound traffic
to that which is necessary

and specifically deny all other traffic.

Install perimeter firewalls
between all wireless networks
and the cardholder data environment.
Configure these firewalls to deny or,
if traffic is necessary for business purposes,
permit only authorized traffic.

- [PCI DSS v3.2.1 - Requirement 1.3.1:](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI_DSS_v3-2-1.pdf)
Implement a **DMZ** to limit inbound traffic
to only system components
that provide authorized publicly
accessible services, protocols,
and ports.

- [PCI DSS v3.2.1 - Requirement 1.3.2:](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI_DSS_v3-2-1.pdf)
Limit inbound Internet traffic
to **IP** addresses within the **DMZ**.

Implement anti-spoofing measures
to detect and block forged source IP
addresses from entering the network.

- [PCI DSS v3.2.1 - Requirement 1.3.4:](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI_DSS_v3-2-1.pdf)
Do not allow unauthorized outbound traffic
from the cardholder data environment
to the Internet.

- [PCI DSS v3.2.1 - Requirement 1.3.6:](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI_DSS_v3-2-1.pdf)
Place system components
that store cardholder data (such as a database)
in an internal network zone, 
egregated from the **DMZ**
and other untrusted networks.
