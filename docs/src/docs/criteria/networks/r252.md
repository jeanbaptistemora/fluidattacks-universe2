Security misconfiguration is the most commonly seen issue.
This is commonly a result of insecure default configurations, incomplete
or ad hoc configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured **HTTP** headers,
and verbose error messages containing sensitive information.
Not only must all operating systems, frameworks, libraries, and applications
be securely configured, but they must be patched/upgraded in a timely fashion.

Use strong cryptography and security protocols to safeguard sensitive
cardholder data during transmission over open, public networks.
The protocol in use only supports secure versions or configurations.

- [PCI DSS v3.2.1 - Requirement 4.1.1:](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI_DSS_v3-2-1.pdf)
Ensure wireless networks transmitting cardholder data or connected to the
cardholder data environment, use industry best practices to implement strong
encryption for authentication and transmission.
