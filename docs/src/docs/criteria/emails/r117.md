- [CAPEC-242: Code Injection:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/242.html)
An adversary exploits a weakness in input validation on the target to inject
new code into that which is currently executing.

- [CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/80.html)
The software receives input from an upstream component,
but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such
as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when
they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

Injection flaws, such as **SQL**, **NoSQL**, **OS**, and *LDAP* injection,
occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or
query.
The attacker's hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended
commands or accessing data without proper authorization.

Address common coding vulnerabilities in software-development processes such as
injection flaws, particularly *SQL* injection.
Also consider *OS* Command Injection, *LDAP* and *XPath* injection flaws as
well as other injection flaws.
