- [CAPEC-242: Code Injection:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/242.html)
An adversary exploits a weakness
in input validation on the target
to inject new code into that
which is currently executing.

- [CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/80.html)
The software receives input
from an upstream component,
but it does not neutralize
or incorrectly neutralizes special characters
such as "<", ">", and "&"
that could be interpreted
as web-scripting elements
when they are sent to a downstream component
that processes web pages.

Injection flaws,
such as **SQL**, **NoSQL**,
**OS** and *LDAP* injection,
occur when untrusted data
is sent to an interpreter
as part of a command or query.
The attacker's hostile data
can trick the interpreter
into executing unintended
commands or accessing data
without proper authorization.

Address common coding vulnerabilities
in software-development processes
such as injection flaws,
particularly *SQL* injection.
Also consider *OS* Command Injection,
*LDAP* and *XPath* injection flaws
as well as other injection flaws.
