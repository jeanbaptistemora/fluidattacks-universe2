## Requirement

The system must guarantee that exposed email addresses
can only be read by humans.

## Description

Sometimes, corporate email addresses are exposed on the companyâ€™s website
or another overly public medium.
These emails should only be visible to human beings,
which can be accomplished by, for instance,
publishing them as images instead of as plain text.
This prevents automatic tools from collecting them
and adding them to bulk email distribution lists.
