## Requirement

The system must guarantee that exposed email addresses
can only be read by humans.

## Description

Sometimes, corporate email addresses
are exposed on the companyâ€™s website
or another overly public medium.
These emails
should only be visible to human beings,
which can be accomplished by,
for instance,
publishing them as images
instead of as plain text.
This prevents automatic tools
from collecting them and adding them
to bulk email distribution lists.
