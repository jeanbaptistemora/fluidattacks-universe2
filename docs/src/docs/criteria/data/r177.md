## Requirement

The system must not store sensitive information
in temporary files or cache memory.

## Description

Applications sometimes reside in or get consumed by environments in which
caching is possible.
Caching helps performance or makes certain actions more comfortable for the
application users.
However, cached information is often more susceptible to being exposed or
corrupted.
Thus, avoiding cache memory and temporary files helps protect sensitive
information.

## Types

- [019. Administrative credentials stored in cache memory](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/019/)

- [028. Insecure temporary files](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/028/)

- [038. Business information leak](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/038/)

- [065. Cached form fields](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/065/)

- [085. Sensitive data stored in the client-side storage](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/085/)

Many web applications and **API**s do not properly protect sensitive data,
such as financial, healthcare, and *PII*.
Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit card
fraud, identity theft, or other crimes.
Sensitive data may be compromised without extra protection,
such as encryption at rest or in transit, and requires special precautions when
exchanged with the browser.

Verify the application protects sensitive data from being cached in server
components such as load balancers and application caches.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V8.1 General Data Protection.(8.1.2):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify that all cached or temporary copies of sensitive data stored on the
server are protected from unauthorized access or purged/invalidated after the
authorized user accesses the sensitive data.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V8.2 Client-side Data Protection.(8.2.1):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify the application sets sufficient anti-caching headers so that sensitive

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V8.2 Client-side Data Protection.(8.2.2):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify that data stored in client side storage (such as HTML5 local storage,
session storage, IndexedDB, regular cookies or Flash cookies) does not contain
sensitive data or PII.
