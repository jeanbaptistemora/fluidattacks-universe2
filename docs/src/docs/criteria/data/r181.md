## Requirement

The transmission of sensitive information
and the execution of sensitive functions
must be performed through secure protocols.

## Description

A system can send information
through a non-encrypted channel using insecure protocols.
The use of these protocols makes it easier to perform a man-in-the-middle
attack (*MitM*) to intercept and modify the information.
Examples of such insecure protocols are *HTTP*, *FTP*, *POP3* and *Telnet*.

## Implementation

1. Deploy applications using *HTTPS* in the application server:
When using this protocol, the channel
used for the deployment of web applications is encrypted.
For this, it is necessary to have certificates
issued by a valid certifying entity.

2. Use secure services instead of standard services:
When you need to transmit sensitive information
using services such as *FTP* and *POP3*,
you can enable secure versions of each protocol
or implement protocols with the same functions
but having communication encryption
such as *SSH*, *FTPS*, *POP3S* and *TLS*.

## Attacks

1. An attacker with access to non-encrypted channels
performs a man-in-the-middle (*MitM*) attack
over the vulnerable assets in order to intercept,
obtain and/or modify the transmitted information.

## References

- [CAPEC-12: Choosing Message Identifier:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/12.html)
This pattern of attack is defined by the selection of messages distributed over
via multicast or public information channels that are intended for another
client by determining the parameter value assigned to that client.
This attack allows the adversary to gain access to potentially privileged
information,
and to possibly perpetrate other attacks through the distribution means by
impersonation.

- [CAPEC-31: Accessing/Intercepting/Modifying HTTP Cookies:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/31.html)
This attack relies on the use of *HTTP* Cookies to store credentials,
state information and other critical data on client systems.
There are several different forms of this attack.
The first form of this attack involves accessing *HTTP* Cookies to mine for
potentially sensitive data contained therein.
The second form involves intercepting this data as it is transmitted from
client to server.

- [CAPEC-94: Man in the Middle Attack:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html)
This type of attack targets the communication between two components
(typically client and server).
The attacker places themself in the communication channel between the two
components.
Whenever one component attempts to communicate with the other
(data flow, authentication challenges, etc.),
the data first goes to the attacker,
who has the opportunity to observe or alter it,
and it is then passed on to the other component as if it was never observed.

- [CAPEC-117: Interception:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/117.html)
An adversary monitors data streams to or from the target for information
gathering purposes.
This attack may be undertaken to solely gather sensitive information or to
support a further attack against the target.
This attack pattern can involve sniffing network traffic as well as other types
of data streams (e.g., radio).

- [CAPEC-148: Content Spoofing:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/148.html)
An adversary modifies content to make it contain something other than what the
original content producer intended while keeping the apparent source of the
content unchanged.

- [CAPEC-216: Communication Channel Manipulation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/216.html)
An adversary manipulates a setting or parameter on communications channel in
order to compromise its security.
This can result in information exposure, insertion/removal of information from
the communications stream, and/or potentially system compromise.

- [CAPEC-594: Traffic Injection:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/594.html)
An adversary injects traffic into the target's network connection.
The adversary is therefore able to degrade or disrupt the connection,
and potentially modify the content.

fraud, identity theft, or other crimes.
Sensitive data may be compromised without extra protection,
such as encryption at rest or in transit, and requires special precautions when
exchanged with the browser.
