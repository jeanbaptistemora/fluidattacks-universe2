## Requirement

The system must use digital signatures
to ensure the authenticity of sensitive information.

## Description

A digital signature is a cryptographic mechanism that helps identify the sender
of a message, and guarantee its authenticity and integrity.
It should be used when dealing with very sensitive information or with
data and resources that are susceptible to being affected by third parties.

## Types

- [086. Missing subresource integrity check](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/086/)

- [103. Insufficient data authenticity validation](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/103/)

- [CAPEC-21: Exploitation of Trusted Identifiers:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/21.html)
An adversary guesses, obtains, or "rides" a trusted identifier
(e.g., session ID, resource ID, cookie, etc.) to perform authorized actions
under the guise of an authenticated user or service.
Attacks on trusted identifiers take advantage of the fact that some software
accepts user input without verifying its authenticity.

- [CAPEC-22: Exploiting Trust in Client:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)
An attack of this type exploits vulnerabilities in client/server communication
channel authentication and data integrity.
It leverages the implicit trust a server places in the client,
or more importantly, that which the server believes is the client.

- [CAPEC-148: Content Spoofing:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/148.html)
An adversary modifies content to make it contain something other than what the
original content producer intended while keeping the apparent source of the
content unchanged.

- [CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/326.html)
The software stores or transmits sensitive data using an encryption scheme that
is theoretically sound,
but is not strong enough for the level of protection required.

- [CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/345.html)
The software does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data,
in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

- [CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/347.html)
The software does not verify, or incorrectly verifies,
the cryptographic signature for data.

- [CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/494.html)
The product downloads source code or an executable from a remote location and
executes the code without sufficiently verifying the origin and integrity of
the code.

Verify that stateless session tokens use digital signatures, encryption, and

Verify that if the application has a client or server auto-update feature,
updates should be obtained over secure channels and digitally signed.
The update code must validate the digital signature of the update before
installing or executing the update.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V10.3 Deployed Application Integrity Controls.(10.3.2):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify that the application employs integrity protections,
such as code signing or sub-resource integrity.
The application must not load or execute code from untrusted sources,
such as loading includes, modules, plugins, code, or libraries from untrusted
sources or the Internet.

Verify that the message headers and payload are trustworthy and not modified
in transit.
Requiring strong encryption for transport (*TLS* only) may be sufficient in
many cases as it provides both confidentiality and integrity protection.
Per-message digital signatures can provide additional assurance on top of the
transport protections for high-security applications but bring with them
additional complexity and risks to weigh against the benefits.

Verify that the message payload is signed using *WS-Security* to ensure
reliable transport between client and service.
