## Requirement

The system must restrict access to system objects
that have sensitive content.
It should only allow access to authorized users.

## Description

Applications usually handle personal and confidential information,
such as personal identifications, social security numbers,
credentials and health histories.
This data should be protected as a fundamental right,
and therefore be stored and transmitted using secure mechanisms that
prevent access to it by unauthorized actors.
Furthermore, the access control model and role assignment policy
must be implemented taking these restrictions into consideration.

Many web applications and **API**s do not properly protect sensitive data,
such as financial, healthcare, and *PII*.
Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit card
fraud, identity theft, or other crimes.
Sensitive data may be compromised without extra protection,
such as encryption at rest or in transit, and requires special precautions when
exchanged with the browser.

Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not
properly enforced.
Attackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionality and/or
data, such as access other users' accounts, view sensitive files,
modify other users' data, change access rights, etc.

Verify that communications between application components,
including APIs, middleware and data layers, are authenticated.
Components should have the least necessary privileges needed.

role.
Permissions should still be allocated using roles.

such as creating or updating someone else's record, viewing everyone's records,
or deleting all records.
