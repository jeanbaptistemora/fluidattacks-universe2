## Requirement

All stored sensitive information must be encrypted.

## Description

Systems usually store personal data, i.e., Personally Identifiable Information
(*PII*), medical records, credentials and other types of sensitive information.
All of these must be encrypted before being stored using safe cryptographic
mechanisms.
This is also applicable when personal information must be temporarily stored
in the client-side storage.
The encryption prevents unauthorized actors that may have accessed the storage
system from obtaining the information.

## Types

Encrypt all sensitive information at rest using a tool that requires a
secondary authentication mechanism not integrated into the operating system,
in order to access the information.

The measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall at least protect personal data
stored or transmitted against accidental or unlawful destruction,
accidental loss or alteration,
and unauthorized or unlawful storage, processing, access or disclosure.

The controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and
organizational measures to ensure an appropriate level of security,
including the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data.

Personal data which are, by their nature, particularly sensitive in relation to
fundamental rights and freedoms merit specific protection as the context of
their processing could create significant risks to the fundamental rights and
freedoms.

Many web applications and **API**s do not properly protect sensitive data,
such as financial, healthcare, and *PII*.
Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit card
fraud, identity theft, or other crimes.
Sensitive data may be compromised without extra protection,
such as encryption at rest or in transit, and requires special precautions when
exchanged with the browser.

information, or data assessed likely to be subject to EU's GDPR.

records.
