## Requirement

Personal, sensitive and session data must not be stored in the client-side
storage
(*localStorage*, *sessionStorage*, cookies without security attributes, mobile
device unencrypted storage, etc.).

## Description

Data placed in the *localStorage* persists after a session is closed
and thus, any actor with access to the browser will be able to obtain it.
Furthermore, data in the *localStorage* or in the *sessionStorage*
is visible to scripts that are running on the browser,
and these scripts could belong to malicious third-parties.
Therefore, no sensitive or session information
should be stored in the client-side storage.

## Types

The adversary modifies state information maintained by the target software or

If successful, the target will use this tainted state and execute in an
unintended manner.

The measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall at least protect personal data
stored or transmitted against accidental or unlawful destruction,
accidental loss or alteration,
and unauthorized or unlawful storage, processing, access or disclosure.

Personal data shall be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security
of the personal data,
including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against
accidental loss, destruction or damage.

Personal data which are, by their nature, particularly sensitive in relation to
fundamental rights and freedoms merit specific protection as the context of
their processing could create significant risks to the fundamental rights and
freedoms.

Secrets used for session binding SHOULD NOT be placed in insecure locations
such as *HTML5* Local Storage due to the potential exposure of local storage to
cross-site scripting (*XSS*) attacks.

Many web applications and **API**s do not properly protect sensitive data,
such as financial, healthcare, and *PII*.
Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit card
fraud, identity theft, or other crimes.
Sensitive data may be compromised without extra protection,
such as encryption at rest or in transit, and requires special precautions when
exchanged with the browser.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V8.2 Client-side Data Protection.(8.2.2):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify that data stored in client side storage (such as *HTML5* local storage,
session storage, **IndexedDB**, regular cookies or *Flash* cookies) does not
contain sensitive data or *PII*.
