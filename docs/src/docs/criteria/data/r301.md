## Requirement

The system must notify the users
whenever their authentication details
or other security settings are changed.

## Description

Most systems allow their users
to modify relevant information,
such as access credentials
and contact data.
Users should be notified
whenever any of these
or other security settings are modified,
as it could be a part of several types of attacks,
e.g., account takeover attacks.
