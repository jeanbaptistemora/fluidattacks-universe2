## Requirement

The system must notify the users whenever their authentication details or other
security settings are changed.

## Description

Most systems allow their users to modify relevant information,
such as access credentials and contact data.
Users should be notified
whenever any of these or other security settings are modified,
as it could be a part of several types of attacks,
e.g., account takeover attacks.
