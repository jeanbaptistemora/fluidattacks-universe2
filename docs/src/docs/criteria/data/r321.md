## Requirement

The system must not deserialize untrusted data
before applying the appropriate integrity checks.

## Description

Serialization is the process of transforming an object into a stream of bytes
to store or transmit it.
This allows saving its state,
so that it can be recovered later using deserialization.
If an object comes from an untrusted source
and is not properly validated before being deserialized,
it can lead to deserialization attacks such as object injection.

## References

- [CAPEC-130: Excessive Allocation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/130.html)
An adversary causes the target to allocate excessive resources to servicing the
attackers' request,
thereby reducing the resources available for legitimate services and degrading
or denying services.
Usually, this attack focuses on memory allocation,
but any finite resource on the target could be the attacked, including
bandwidth, processing cycles, or other resources.

- [CAPEC-153: Input Data Manipulation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/153.html)
An attacker exploits a weakness in input validation by controlling the format,
structure, and composition of data to an input-processing interface.
By supplying input of a non-standard or unexpected form an attacker can
adversely impact the security of the target.

- [CAPEC-248: Command Injection:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/248.html)
An adversary looking to execute a command of their choosing,
injects new items into an existing command thus modifying interpretation away
from what was intended.

- [CAPEC-586: Object Injection:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/586.html)
An adversary attempts to exploit an application by injecting additional,
malicious content during its processing of serialized objects.

- [CWE-94: Code Injection:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html)
The software constructs all or part of a code segment using
externally-influenced input from an upstream component,
but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that
could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment.

- [CWE-95: Eval Injection:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/95.html)
The software receives input from an upstream component,
but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using
the input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g., "*eval*").

- [CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)
The application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that
the resulting data will be valid.

Injection flaws, such as **SQL**, **NoSQL**, **OS**, and *LDAP* injection,
occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or
query.
The attacker's hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended
commands or accessing data without proper authorization.

Many older or poorly configured *XML* processors evaluate external entity
references within *XML* documents.
External entities can be used to disclose internal files using the file *URI*
handler, internal file shares, internal port scanning, remote code execution,
and denial of service attacks.

Insecure deserialization often leads to remote code execution.
Even if deserialization flaws do not result in remote code execution,
they can be used to perform attacks,
including replay attacks, injection attacks, and privilege escalation attacks.

Verify that serialization is not used when communicating with untrusted
clients.
If this is not possible,
ensure that adequate integrity controls
(and possibly encryption if sensitive data is sent)
are enforced to prevent deserialization attacks including object injection.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V5.5 Deserialization Prevention Requirements.(5.5.1):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify that serialized objects use integrity checks or are encrypted to prevent
hostile object creation or data tampering.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V5.5 Deserialization Prevention Requirements.(5.5.3):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify that deserialization of untrusted data is avoided or is protected in
both custom code and third-party libraries
(such as *JSON*, *XML* and *YAML* parsers).

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V5.5 Deserialization Prevention Requirements.(5.5.4):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify that when parsing *JSON* in browsers or JavaScript-based backends,
**JSON.parse** is used to parse the *JSON* document.
Do not use **eval()** to parse *JSON*.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V13.2 RESTful Web Service Verification Requirements.(13.2.2):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)

input.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V13.3 SOAP Web Service Verification Requirements.(13.3.1):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify that *XSD* schema validation takes place to ensure a properly formed
*XML* document,
followed by validation of each input field before any processing of that data
takes place.

Address common coding vulnerabilities in software-development processes such as

Also consider *OS* Command Injection, *LDAP* and *XPath* injection flaws as
well as other injection flaws.
