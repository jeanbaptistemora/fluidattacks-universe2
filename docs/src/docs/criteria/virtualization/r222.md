- [CAPEC-115: Authentication Bypass:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/115.html)
An attacker gains access to application, service, or device with the privileges
of an authorized or privileged user by evading or circumventing an
authentication mechanism.
The attacker is therefore able to access protected data without authentication
ever having taken place.
