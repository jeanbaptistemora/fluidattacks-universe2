## Requirement

The system should use typified exceptions instead of generic exceptions.

## Description

Catching generic exceptions obscures the problem that caused the error and
promotes a generic way to handle different categories or sources of error.
This may cause security vulnerabilities to materialize,
as some special flows go unnoticed.

## Types

- [060. Insecure exceptions](/types/060)

## References

- [CWE-396: Declaration of Catch for Generic Exception:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/396.html)
Catching overly broad exceptions promotes complex error handling code that is
more likely to contain security vulnerabilities.

Throwing overly broad exceptions promotes complex error handling code that is
more likely to contain security vulnerabilities.

Verify that access controls fail securely including when an exception occurs.

Verify that exception handling (or a functional equivalent) is used across the
codebase to account for expected and unexpected error conditions.
