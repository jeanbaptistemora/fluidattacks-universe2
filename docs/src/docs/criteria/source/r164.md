- [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)
The product does not validate or incorrectly validates input that can affect
the control flow or data flow of a program.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V5.1 Input Validation Requirements.(5.1.4):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
