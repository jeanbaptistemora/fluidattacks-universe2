- [CAPEC-21: Exploitation of Trusted Identifiers:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/21.html)
An adversary guesses, obtains,
or "rides" a trusted identifier
(e.g., session ID, resource ID, cookie, etc.)
to perform authorized actions
under the guise of an authenticated user
or service.
Attacks on trusted identifiers
take advantage of the fact that some software
accepts user input without verifying its authenticity.

- [CAPEC-31: Accessing/Intercepting/Modifying HTTP Cookies:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/31.html)
This attack relies on the use of *HTTP* Cookies
to store credentials, state information
and other critical data on client systems.
There are several different forms of this attack.
The first form of this attack involves accessing *HTTP* Cookies
to mine for potentially sensitive data contained therein.
The second form
involves intercepting this data as it is transmitted
from client to server.

- [CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)
The web application does not,
or can not,
sufficiently verify whether a well-formed,
valid, consistent request was intentionally provided
by the user who submitted the request.

Verify that the application
or framework enforces a strong anti-*CSRF* mechanism
to protect authenticated functionality,
and effective anti-automation
or anti-*CSRF* protects unauthenticated functionality.
