## Requirement

The source code of a system must not perform functions
other than those specified in the functional requirements (backdoors).

## Description

Sometimes, functionalities other than the ones for which a system was designed
are included during development to aid the development and testing processes.
These functions often represent backdoors because they leave ports exposed
or help in bypassing the authentication and/or authorization mechanisms.
Therefore, they should not be part of the production environment,
as they could become serious security vulnerabilities.

- [CAPEC-113: API Manipulation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/113.html)
An adversary manipulates the use or processing of an Application Programming
Interface (*API*) resulting in an adverse impact upon the security of the
system implementing the *API*.
This can allow the adversary to execute functionality not intended by the *API*
implementation,
possibly compromising the system which integrates the *API*.

- [CAPEC-115: Authentication Bypass:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/115.html)
An attacker gains access to application, service, or device with the privileges
of an authorized or privileged user by evading or circumventing an
authentication mechanism.
The attacker is therefore able to access protected data without authentication
ever having taken place.

An attacker modifies a technology, product, or component during a stage in its
manufacture for the purpose of carrying out an attack against some entity
involved in the supply chain lifecycle.

An adversary attacks a system by bypassing some or all functionality intended

Any user or system accounts used to perform penetration testing should be
controlled and monitored to make sure they are only being used for legitimate
purposes,
and are removed or restored to normal function after testing is over.

A trapdoor is a hidden piece of code that responds to a special input,
allowing its user access to resources without passing through the normal
security enforcement mechanism.

Verify all code including third-party binaries, libraries, frameworks are
reviewed for hardcoded credentials (*backdoors*).

Verify that the application source code and third party libraries do not contain
backdoors,
such as hard-coded or additional undocumented accounts or keys,
code obfuscation, undocumented binary blobs, rootkits,
or anti-debugging, insecure debugging features,
or otherwise out of date, insecure, or hidden functionality that could be used
maliciously if discovered.

Processes must include removal of test data and accounts from system components
before the system becomes active / goes into production.
