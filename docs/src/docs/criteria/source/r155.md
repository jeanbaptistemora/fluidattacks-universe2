## Requirement

The application code must be free of malicious code.

## Description

There are several ways in which malicious code may be included in an
application.
It can be imported as part of third party libraries,
which may be intentionally malicious or have exploitable vulnerabilities,
or it can come as a backdoor left by one of the developers.
Therefore, the source code should be audited to guarantee it does not have any
backdoors, rootkits, time bombs, logic bombs, etc.
