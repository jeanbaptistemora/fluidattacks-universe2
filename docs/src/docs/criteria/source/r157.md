## Requirement

The organization should set its parsers, linters, compilers and interpreters
to run in strict mode.

- [CAPEC-123: Buffer Manipulation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/123.html)
An adversary manipulates an application's interaction with a buffer in an
attempt to read or modify data they shouldn't have access to.
Buffer attacks are distinguished in that it is the buffer space itself that is
the target of the attack rather than any code responsible for interpreting the
content of the buffer.

- [CAPEC-129: Pointer Manipulation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/129.html)
This attack pattern involves an adversary manipulating a pointer within a
target application resulting in the application accessing an unintended memory
location.
This can result in the crashing of the application or,
for certain pointer values, access to data that would not normally be possible
or the execution of arbitrary code.

- [CAPEC-130: Excessive Allocation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/130.html)
An adversary causes the target to allocate excessive resources to servicing the
attackers' request,
thereby reducing the resources available for legitimate services and degrading
or denying services.
Usually, this attack focuses on memory allocation,
but any finite resource on the target could be the attacked, including
bandwidth, processing cycles, or other resources.

- [CWE-120: Classic Buffer Overflow:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html)
The program copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that
the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer,
leading to a buffer overflow.

- [CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)
The software processes an *XML* document that can contain *XML* entities with
**URI**s that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control,
causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

- [OWASP Top 10 A4:2017-XML External Entities (XXE):](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A4-XML_External_Entities_(XXE))
Many older or poorly configured *XML* processors evaluate external entity
references within *XML* documents.
External entities can be used to disclose internal files using the file *URI*
handler, internal file shares, internal port scanning, remote code execution,
and denial of service attacks.

Security misconfiguration is the most commonly seen issue.
This is commonly a result of insecure default configurations,
incomplete or ad hoc configurations, open cloud storage,
misconfigured *HTTP* headers,
and verbose error messages containing sensitive information.
Not only must all operating systems, frameworks, libraries, and applications be
securely configured, but they must be patched/upgraded in a timely fashion.

Insecure deserialization often leads to remote code execution.
Even if deserialization flaws do not result in remote code execution,
they can be used to perform attacks,
including replay attacks, injection attacks, and privilege escalation attacks.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 Appendix C: Internet of Things Verification Requirements.(C.33):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify that secure compiler flags such as **-fPIE**, **-fstack-protector-all**,
**-Wl**, **-z,noexecstack**, **-Wl**, **-z,noexecheap** are configured for
firmware builds.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V5.5 Deserialization Prevention Requirements.(5.5.2):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify that the application correctly restricts *XML* parsers to only use the
most restrictive configuration possible and to ensure that unsafe features such
as resolving external entities are disabled to prevent *XXE*.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V14.1 Build.(14.1.2):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify that compiler flags are configured to enable all available buffer
overflow protections and warnings,
including stack randomization, data execution prevention,
and to break the build if an unsafe pointer, memory, format string, integer,
or string operations are found.

buffer overflows.
