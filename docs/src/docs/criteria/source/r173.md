## Requirement

The system must discard
all potentially harmful information received
via data inputs.

## Description

Technological devices and,
in particular,
applications must be able to notice
if the received information does not correspond
to its operational purposes,
in order to treat it properly
(for example, rejecting and/or generating timely alerts)
and ensure that it does not impact the operation negatively.
Typical examples of this are:
*SQL* queries, *JavaScript* code,
*OS* commands or *LDAP* queries
in fields and application parameters;
text with undesired special characters
and their possible combinations
in fields and parameters;
files manipulated in structure and extension
to be loaded in an application or technology artifact;
and in general any type of information
that does not correspond to the requested format.
A large amount of the incoming traffic
(which does not correspond to operational purposes)
of a technological artifact must also be considered,
and controls and proper treatment must be applied.

## Implementation

1. Perform whitelisting instead of blacklisting:
By using this principle,
the control implementation will be configured
to reject all inputs
that are not explicitly approved,
thus discarding all possible scenarios
and forcing enumeration of strictly allowed inputs
(e.g., allow only *a-z*, *A-Z* and *0-9*).

2. Use variable highlighting: If supported,
language and compiler can detect foreign variables
that are not validated by a filter.
To this end,
you may use techniques to highlight those variables
and compilers, or pre-processors to detect
that they are not validated.

3. Not only user validation but also input validation:
Any input from outside the application
must be considered malicious.
In other words,
the user can enter incorrect information,
as well as potentially harmful inputs,
that may also compromise external systems,
and therefore this information must be validated.

## Attacks

1. Inject malicious software or code.
2. Denial of service caused by register overload.
3. Cross-Site Scripting (*XSS*).
4. *OS* command injection.
5. *SQL* injection.
6. *LDAP* injection.
7. Redirect to untrusted pages.

## References

- [CAPEC-3: Using Leading 'Ghost' Character Sequences to Bypass Input Filters:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/3.html)
An adversary can intentionally introduce
leading "ghost" characters
(extra characters that don't affect the validity
of the request at the *API* layer)
that enable the input to pass the filters
and therefore process the adversary's input.

- [CAPEC-4: Using Alternative IP Address Encodings:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/4.html)
Networked applications
may expect network location information
in a specific format,
such as fully qualified domains names (**FQDN**s),
*URL*, *IP* address, or *IP* Address ranges.
If the location information is not validated
against a variety of different possible encodings and formats,
the adversary can use an alternate format
to bypass application access control.

- [CAPEC-6: Argument Injection:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/6.html)
An attacker changes the behavior
or state of a targeted application through injecting data
or command syntax through the targets use of non-validated
and non-filtered arguments
of exposed services or methods.

- [CAPEC-7: Blind SQL Injection:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/7.html)
Blind *SQL* Injection
results from an insufficient mitigation for *SQL* Injection.
Blind *SQL* Injection
is a form of *SQL* Injection
that overcomes the lack of error messages.

- [CAPEC-15: Command Delimiters:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/15.html)
The system that uses a filter
or denylist input validation,
as opposed to allowlist validation
is vulnerable to an attacker who predicts delimiters
(or combinations of delimiters)
not present in the filter or denylist.

- [CAPEC-18: XSS Targeting Non-Script Elements:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/18.html)
This attack is a form of Cross-Site Scripting (*XSS*)
where malicious scripts are embedded in elements
that are not expected to host scripts
such as image tags (`<img>`),
comments in *XML* documents (`<!-CDATA->`), etc.
These tags
may not be subject to the same input validation,
output validation,
and other content filtering and checking routines.

- [CAPEC-19: Embedding Scripts within Scripts:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/19.html)
An attack of this type exploits
a programs' vulnerabilities that are brought on
by allowing remote hosts to execute scripts.
The adversary leverages this capability
to execute their own script
by embedding it within other scripts
that the target software is likely to execute.
The adversary
must have the ability to inject their script
into a script that is likely to be executed.

- [CAPEC-22: Exploiting Trust in Client:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)
An attack of this type exploits vulnerabilities
in client/server communication channel authentication
and data integrity.
It leverages
the implicit trust a server places in the client,
or more importantly,
that which the server believes is the client.

- [CAPEC-32: XSS Through HTTP Query Strings:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/32.html)
An adversary embeds malicious script code
in the parameters of an *HTTP* query string
and convinces a victim to submit the *HTTP* request
that contains the query string
to a vulnerable web application.
The web application then procedes
to use the values parameters
without properly validation them first
and generates the HTML code that will be executed
by the victim's browser.

- [CAPEC-34: HTTP Response Splitting:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/34.html)
This attack uses a maliciously-crafted *HTTP* request
in order to cause a vulnerable web server
to respond with an *HTTP* response stream
that will be interpreted by the client
as two separate responses instead of one.
This is possible
when user-controlled input is used unvalidated
as part of the response headers.

- [CAPEC-41: Using Meta-characters in E-mail Headers to Inject Malicious Payloads:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/41.html)
This type of attack
involves an attacker leveraging meta-characters
in email headers to inject improper behavior
into email programs.

- [CAPEC-48: Passing Local Filenames to Functions That Expect a URL:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/48.html)
This attack relies on client side code
to access local files and resources
instead of **URL**s.
When the client browser is expecting a *URL* string,
but instead receives a request for a local file,
that execution is likely to occur
in the browser process space
with the browser's authority to local files.

- [CAPEC-130: Excessive Allocation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/130.html)
An adversary causes the target
to allocate excessive resources
to servicing the attackers' request,
thereby reducing the resources available
for legitimate services
and degrading or denying services.
Usually,
this attack focuses on memory allocation,
but any finite resource on the target
could be the attacked,
including bandwidth, processing cycles,
or other resources.

- [CAPEC-137: Parameter Injection:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/137.html)

of request parameters for the purpose
of undermining the security of the target.

- [CAPEC-153: Input Data Manipulation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/153.html)
An attacker exploits a weakness in input validation
by controlling the format, structure,
and composition of data
to an input-processing interface.
By supplying input of a non-standard
or unexpected form
an attacker can adversely impact
the security of the target.

- [CAPEC-175: Code Inclusion:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/175.html)
An adversary exploits a weakness on the target
to force arbitrary code
to be retrieved locally
or from a remote location and executed.

- [CAPEC-240: Resource Injection:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/240.html)
An adversary exploits weaknesses in input validation

- [OWASP Top 10 A1:2017-Injection:](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection)
Injection flaws,
such as **SQL**, **NoSQL**,
**OS** and *LDAP* injection,
occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter
as part of a command or query.
The attacker's hostile data
can trick the interpreter
into executing unintended commands
or accessing data
without proper authorization.

- [OWASP Top 10 A4:2017-XML External Entities (XXE):](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A4-XML_External_Entities_(XXE))
Many older or poorly configured *XML* processors
evaluate external entity references
within *XML* documents.
External entities
can be used to disclose internal files
using the file *URI* handler,
internal file shares, internal port scanning,

whenever an application includes untrusted data
in a new web page without proper validation or escaping,
or updates an existing web page
with user-supplied data
using a browser *API* that can create *HTML* or **JavaScript**.
*XSS* allows attackers
to execute scripts in the victim's browser
which can hijack user sessions,
deface web sites,
or redirect the user to malicious sites.
