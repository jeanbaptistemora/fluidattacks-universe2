## Requirement

The system must use parameterized queries
or stored procedures to create dynamic sentences
(e.g., *java.sql.PreparedStatement*).

## Types

- [001. SQL injection](/types/001)

- [105. Apache Lucene query injection](/types/105)

## References

- [CAPEC-7: Blind SQL Injection:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/7.html)
Blind *SQL* Injection results
from an insufficient mitigation for *SQL* Injection.
Blind *SQL* Injection
is a form of *SQL* Injection
that overcomes the lack of error messages.

- [CAPEC-248: Command Injection:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/248.html)
An adversary looking to execute a command
of their choosing,
injects new items into an existing command
thus modifying interpretation away
from what was intended.

- [CWE-89: SQL Injection:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)
The software constructs all
or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input
from an upstream component,
but it does not neutralize
or incorrectly neutralizes special elements
that could modify the intended SQL command.

Injection flaws,
such as **SQL**, **NoSQL**,
**OS** and *LDAP* injection,
occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter
as part of a command or query.
The attacker's hostile data
can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands
or accessing data without proper authorization.

Verify that data selection
or database queries
(e.g., *SQL*, *HQL*, *ORM*, *NoSQL*)
use parameterized queries, *ORMs*,
entity frameworks,
or are otherwise protected from database injection attacks.

Address common coding vulnerabilities
in software-development processes
such as injection flaws,
particularly *SQL* injection.
Also consider *OS* Command Injection,
*LDAP* and *XPath* injection flaws
as well as other injection flaws.
