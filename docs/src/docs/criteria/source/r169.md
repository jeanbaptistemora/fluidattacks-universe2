## Requirement

The system must use parameterized queries or stored procedures
to create dynamic sentences (e.g., *java.sql.PreparedStatement*).

## Types

- [001. SQL injection](https://docs.fluidattacks.com/types/001)

- [105. Apache Lucene query injection](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/105/)

- [CAPEC-7: Blind SQL Injection:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/7.html)
Blind *SQL* Injection results from an insufficient mitigation for *SQL*
Injection.
Blind *SQL* Injection is a form of *SQL* Injection that overcomes the lack of
error messages.

- [CAPEC-248: Command Injection:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/248.html)
An adversary looking to execute a command of their choosing,
injects new items into an existing command thus modifying interpretation away
from what was intended.

- [CWE-89: SQL Injection:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)
The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using
externally-influenced input from an upstream component,
but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that
could modify the intended SQL command.

Injection flaws, such as **SQL**, **NoSQL**, **OS**, and *LDAP* injection,
occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or
query.
The attacker's hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended
commands or accessing data without proper authorization.

Verify that data selection or database queries
(e.g., *SQL*, *HQL*, *ORM*, *NoSQL*) use parameterized queries, *ORMs*,
entity frameworks, or are otherwise protected from database injection attacks.

Address common coding vulnerabilities in software-development processes such as
injection flaws, particularly *SQL* injection.
Also consider *OS* Command Injection, *LDAP* and *XPath* injection flaws as
well as other injection flaws.
