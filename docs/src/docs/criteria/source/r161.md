## Requirement

The source code must have secure default options
ensuring secure failures in the application
(**try, catch/except**; *default* for *switches*).

## Description

The organization must ensure that its own systems and those of third parties
are safe and fully comply with the functions for which they were implemented.
For this, baselines must be implemented from the design and development phase,
in order to avoid bad practices in the development cycles,
e.g., the use of a conditional without a default option,
which can cause unexpected behaviors in the system.

The system's source code is safer when good programming practices are
implemented from the development stage,
ensuring the portability and maintenance of the application.
If a system is difficult to maintain,
vulnerabilities are more prone to arise.

## Implementation

1. Definition of baselines from design/architecture stages
in order to guarantee the implementation of good programming practices
in the development of the source code.

2. Quality code and source code vulnerability scanners:
These are tools that perform code revision using lexical and syntactical
analyzers. They process it, suggest improvements and highlight possible
vulnerabilities in the development stage.
Using this kind of tools during the development process
helps improve performance, detect excessively complex logic
and detect potential security issues.

## Attacks

1. Cause unexpected behaviors in the application.
2. Leak sensitive information from unexpected errors.

- [CAPEC-24: Filter Failure through Buffer Overflow:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/24.html)
In this attack, the idea is to cause an active filter to fail by causing an
oversized transaction.
An attacker may try to feed overly long input strings to the program in an
attempt to overwhelm the filter (by causing a buffer overflow) and hoping that
the filter does not fail securely
(i.e., the user input is let into the system unfiltered).

- [CAPEC-28: Fuzzing:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/28.html)
In this attack pattern, the adversary leverages fuzzing to try to identify
weaknesses in the system.
Fuzzing is a software security and functionality testing method that feeds
randomly constructed input to the system and looks for an indication that a
failure in response to that input has occurred.

- [CWE-396: Declaration of Catch for Generic Exception;](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/396.html)
Catching overly broad exceptions promotes complex error handling code that is
more likely to contain security vulnerabilities.

Throwing overly broad exceptions promotes complex error handling code that is

- [CWE-478: Missing Default Case in Switch Statement:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/478.html)
The code does not have a default case in a switch statement,
which might lead to complex logical errors and resultant weaknesses.

- [CWE-544: Missing Standardized Error Handling Mechanism:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/544.html)
The software does not use a standardized method for handling errors throughout
the code,
which might introduce inconsistent error handling and resultant weaknesses.
