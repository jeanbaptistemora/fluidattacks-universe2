## Requirement

The system should not use dynamic code execution features such as **eval()**.

## Description

Dynamic code execution features, despite the flexibility they provide,
should be used carefully and generally avoided.
These features often open the door for remote code execution (*RCE*) and
cross-site scripting (*XSS*) attacks.
Therefore, if it is not possible to avoid dynamic code execution,
any untrusted input being included (e.g., the one provided by the users) should
be properly sanitized.

- [CAPEC-19: Embedding Scripts within Scripts:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/19.html)
An attack of this type exploits a programs' vulnerabilities that are brought on
by allowing remote hosts to execute scripts.
The adversary leverages this capability to execute their own script by
embedding it within other scripts that the target software is likely to
execute.
The adversary must have the ability to inject their script into a script that
is likely to be executed.

- [CAPEC-242: Code Injection:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/242.html)
An adversary exploits a weakness in input validation on the target to inject
new code into that which is currently executing.

- [CAPEC-248: Command Injection:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/248.html)
An adversary looking to execute a command of their choosing,
injects new items into an existing command thus modifying interpretation away
from what was intended.

- [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)
The product does not validate or incorrectly validates input that can affect
the control flow or data flow of a program.

- [CWE-94: Code Injection:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html)
The software constructs all or part of a code segment using
externally-influenced input from an upstream component,
but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that
could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment.

- [CWE-95: Eval Injection:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/95.html)
The software receives input from an upstream component,
but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using
the input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g., "*eval*").

- [OWASP Top 10 A1:2017-Injection:](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection)
Injection flaws, such as **SQL**, **NoSQL**, **OS**, and *LDAP* injection,
occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or
query.
The attacker's hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended
commands or accessing data without proper authorization.

*XSS* flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web
page without proper validation or escaping,
or updates an existing web page with user-supplied data using a browser *API*
that can create *HTML* or **JavaScript**.
*XSS* allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim's browser which can
hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious
sites.

Verify that the application and firmware components are not susceptible to *OS*
Command Injection by invoking shell command wrappers, scripts,
or that security controls prevent *OS* Command Injection.

execution features.
Where there is no alternative, any user input being included must be sanitized
or sandboxed before being executed.

*SVG* scriptable content,
especially as they relate to *XSS* resulting from inline scripts, and
*foreignObject*.

scriptable or expression template language content,
such as Markdown, *CSS* or *XSL* stylesheets, *BBCode*, or similar.
