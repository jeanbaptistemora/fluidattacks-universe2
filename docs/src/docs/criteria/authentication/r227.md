## Requirement

The system must notify, upon any access attempt,
that access to the system is only available for authorized users.

## Description

Sometimes systems have information
and other resources that are not considered public.
These resources should be protected by a secure authentication mechanism that
prevents unauthorized actors from accessing them.
Whenever a non-authenticated actor attempts to access those resources,
the system must notify them that
the resources are only available to authorized users.

## Types

- [006. Authentication mechanism absence or evasion](/types/006)

## References

- [CWE-287: Improper Authentication:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287.html)
When an actor claims to have a given identity,
the software does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

- [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html)
The software does not perform any authentication for functionality that
requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of
resources.

Verify that communications between application components,
including APIs, middleware and data layers, are authenticated.
Components should have the least necessary privileges needed.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V1.2 Authentication Architectural Requirements.(1.2.3):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify that the application uses a single vetted authentication mechanism that
is known to be secure,
can be extended to include strong authentication,
and has sufficient logging and monitoring to detect account abuse or breaches.
