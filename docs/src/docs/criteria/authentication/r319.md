## Requirement

All of the system's authentication pathways and identity management APIs
must be equally secure.

## Description

Some systems offer more than one option to authenticate their users or verify
their identity.
All of these options must have the same security control strength,
so that there is no weaker alternative.

## Types

- [006. Authentication mechanism absence or evasion](https://docs.fluidattacks.com/types/006)

- [015. Insecure authentication method](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/015/)

- [056. Anonymous connection](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/056/)

- [081. Lack of two-factor authentication](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/081/)

- [CAPEC-114: Authentication Abuse:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/114.html)
An attacker obtains unauthorized access to an application, service or device
either through knowledge of the inherent weaknesses of an authentication
mechanism,
or by exploiting a flaw in the authentication scheme's implementation.
In such an attack an authentication mechanism is functioning but a carefully
controlled sequence of events causes the mechanism to grant access to the
attacker.

- [CAPEC-115: Authentication Bypass:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/115.html)
An attacker gains access to application, service, or device with the privileges
of an authorized or privileged user by evading or circumventing an
authentication mechanism.
The attacker is therefore able to access protected data without authentication
ever having taken place.

- [CAPEC-151: Identity Spoofing:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/151.html)
Identity Spoofing refers to the action of assuming (i.e., taking on) the
identity of some other entity (human or non-human) and then using that identity
to accomplish a goal.
An adversary may craft messages that appear to come from a different principle
or use stolen / spoofed authentication credentials.
Alternatively, an adversary may intercept a message from a legitimate sender
and attempt to make it look like the message comes from them without changing
its content.

When an actor claims to have a given identity,
the software does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

- [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html)
The software does not perform any authentication for functionality that
requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of
resources.

Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users' identities
temporarily or permanently.

consistent authentication security control strength,
such that there are no weaker alternatives per the risk of the application.
