## Requirement

All of the system's authentication pathways
and identity management APIs
must be equally secure.

## Description

Some systems offer more than one option
to authenticate their users
or verify their identity.
All of these options must have
the same security control strength,
so that there is no weaker alternative.

## Types

- [006. Authentication mechanism absence or evasion](/types/006)

- [015. Insecure authentication method](/types/015)

- [056. Anonymous connection](/types/056)

- [081. Lack of two-factor authentication](/types/081)

- [CAPEC-114: Authentication Abuse:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/114.html)
An attacker obtains unauthorized access to an application, 
service or device
either through knowledge of the inherent weaknesses
of an authentication mechanism,
or by exploiting a flaw
in the authentication scheme's implementation.
In such an attack
an authentication mechanism is functioning
but a carefully controlled sequence of events
causes the mechanism to grant access to the attacker.

- [CAPEC-115: Authentication Bypass:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/115.html)
An attacker gains access to application, service,
or device with the privileges
of an authorized or privileged user
by evading or circumventing an authentication mechanism.
The attacker is therefore able
to access protected data
without authentication
ever having taken place.

- [CAPEC-151: Identity Spoofing:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/151.html)
Identity Spoofing refers to the action
of assuming (i.e., taking on)
the identity of some other entity (human or non-human)
and then using that identity
to accomplish a goal.
An adversary may craft messages that appear
to come from a different principle
or use stolen / spoofed authentication credentials.
Alternatively,
an adversary may intercept a message
from a legitimate sender
and attempt to make it look like the message
comes from them
without changing its content.

- [CWE-287: Improper Authentication:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287.html)
When an actor claims to have a given identity,
the software does not prove
or insufficiently proves
that the claim is correct.

- [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html)
The software does not perform any authentication
for functionality
that requires a provable user identity
or consumes a significant amount of resources.

Application functions related to authentication
and session management
are often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys,
or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws
to assume other users' identities
temporarily or permanently.

Verify that all authentication pathways
and identity management APIs implement
consistent authentication security control strength,
such that there are no weaker alternatives
per the risk of the application.
