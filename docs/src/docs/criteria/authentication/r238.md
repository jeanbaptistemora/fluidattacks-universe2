## Requirement

The system must guarantee that
the person performing the password recovery
or reset process
is actually the owner.

## Description

Systems must have mechanisms
that enable users to update
and recover their passwords while guaranteeing
the authenticity of the request.
In the case of a password update,
the system must request both the new
and the old passwords.
If the user wants to recover
a lost or forgotten password,
the system must ascertain the user's ownership
of the corresponding account.

## Types

- [033. Password change without identity check](/types/033)

- [CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/345.html)
The software does not sufficiently verify
the origin or authenticity of data,
in a way that causes it
to accept invalid data.

- [CWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/602.html)
The software is composed of a server
that relies on the client
to implement a mechanism that is intended
to protect the server.

- [CWE-620: Unverified Password Change:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/620.html)
When setting a new password for a user,
the product does not require knowledge
of the original password,
or using another form of authentication.

- [CWE-640: Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/640.html)
The software contains a mechanism for users
to recover or change their passwords
without knowing the original password,
but the mechanism is weak.

Application functions related to authentication
and session management
are often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys,
or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws
to assume other users' identities
temporarily or permanently.

Verify that trusted enforcement points
such as at access control gateways, servers,
and serverless functions
enforce access controls.
Never enforce access controls on the client.

Verify that password change functionality
requires the user's current
and new password.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V2.5 Credential Recovery Requirements.(2.5.6):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify forgotten password,
and other recovery paths
use a secure recovery mechanism,
such as *TOTP* or other soft token, mobile push,
or another offline recovery mechanism.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V4.1 General Access Control Design.(4.1.1):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify that the application enforces
access control rules
on a trusted service layer,
especially if client-side access control
is present and could be bypassed.
