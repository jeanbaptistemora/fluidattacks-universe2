## Requirement

The system must require authentication for all resources,
except for the consultation or visualization
of those specifically classified as public.

## Description

Sometimes systems have information and other resources that are not considered
public.
These resources should be protected by a secure authentication mechanism that
prevents unauthorized actors from accessing them.

## Types

- [006. Authentication mechanism absence or evasion](https://docs.fluidattacks.com/types/006)

- [018. Improper authentication for shared folders](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/018/)

- [056. Anonymous connection](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/056/)

- [075. Unauthorized access to files](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/075/)

- [081. Lack of two-factor authentication](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/081/)

In the case that the administrator failed to specify an Access Control List
(*ACL*) for a particular element,
an attacker may be able to access it with impunity.
An attacker with the ability to access functionality not properly constrained
by **ACL**s can obtain sensitive information and possibly compromise the entire
application.

- [CAPEC-36: Using Unpublished Interfaces:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/36.html)
An adversary searches for and invokes interfaces that the target system
designers did not intend to be publicly available.
If these interfaces fail to authenticate requests the attacker may be able to
invoke functionality they are not authorized for.

- [CAPEC-115: Authentication Bypass:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/115.html)
An attacker gains access to application, service, or device with the privileges
of an authorized or privileged user by evading or circumventing an
authentication mechanism.
The attacker is therefore able to access protected data without authentication
ever having taken place.

Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users' identities
temporarily or permanently.

Many web applications and **API**s do not properly protect sensitive data,
such as financial, healthcare, and *PII*.
Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit card
fraud, identity theft, or other crimes.
Sensitive data may be compromised without extra protection,
such as encryption at rest or in transit, and requires special precautions when
exchanged with the browser.
