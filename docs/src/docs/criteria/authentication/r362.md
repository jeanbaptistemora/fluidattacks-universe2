## Requirement

The system must associate
each secondary authentication mechanism
with a single account.

## Description

Single-factor authentication mechanisms
often offer poor security
due to the weak, common
or easy-to-guess passwords
that users tend to set.
Secondary authentication mechanisms,
such as physical
or logical security tokens,
smart cards and certificates,
help guarantee the identity of actors
trying to authenticate.
However,
their value highly decreases
when they are shared
by multiple accounts.

When an actor claims to have a given identity,
the software does not prove
or insufficiently proves
that the claim is correct.

Application functions related to authentication

are often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys,

or to exploit other implementation flaws
to assume other users' identities
temporarily or permanently.

consistent authentication security control strength,
