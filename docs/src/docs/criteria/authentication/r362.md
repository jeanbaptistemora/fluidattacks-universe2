## Requirement

The system must associate each secondary authentication mechanism with a single
account.

## Description

Single-factor authentication mechanisms often offer poor security due to
the weak, common or easy-to-guess passwords that users tend to set.
Secondary authentication mechanisms, such as physical
or logical security tokens, smart cards and certificates,
help guarantee the identity of actors trying to authenticate.
However, their value highly decreases
when they are shared by multiple accounts.

When an actor claims to have a given identity,
the software does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users' identities
temporarily or permanently.

consistent authentication security control strength,
such that there are no weaker alternatives per the risk of the application.
