## Requirement

The system must expire out of band authentication requests, codes or tokens
after 10 minutes and should only allow them to be used once within this period.

## Description

Secure out of band authenticators are physical devices that can communicate
with an authentication verifier over a secure secondary channel.
They serve as an additional security measure for identity assertion during
authentication processes or sensitive transactions.
Systems should expire out of band tokens after 10 minutes and allow them to be
used only once within this period to prevent replay attacks.

When an actor claims to have a given identity,
the software does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

- [CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/294.html)
A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the software makes it possible
for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by
replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original
message (or with minor changes).

Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users' identities
temporarily or permanently.
