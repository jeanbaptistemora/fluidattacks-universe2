## Requirement

Password hints and knowledge-based authentication,
such as **secret questions**,
should not be enabled.

## Description

Password hints often offer enough information for an attacker to guess a user's
password.
Answers to **secret questions** are sometimes information that is publicly
available or that can be found on social media.
Therefore, these mechanisms should not be part of the authentication process
and should not be used in the password recovery process either.

- [CWE-640: Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/640.html)
The software contains a mechanism for users to recover or change their
passwords without knowing the original password,
but the mechanism is weak.

Memorized secret verifiers SHALL NOT permit the subscriber to store a “hint”
that is accessible to an unauthenticated claimant.
Verifiers SHALL NOT prompt subscribers to use specific types of information
(e.g., “What was the name of your first pet?”) when choosing memorized secrets.

Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users' identities
temporarily or permanently.
