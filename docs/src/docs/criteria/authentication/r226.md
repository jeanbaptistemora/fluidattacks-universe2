## Requirement

The system must never block a user account
after one or several failed authentication attempts.

## References

- [CAPEC-2: Inducing Account Lockout:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/2.html)
Many systems implement a password throttling mechanism that locks an account
after a certain number of incorrect log in attempts.
An attacker can leverage this throttling mechanism to lock a legitimate user
out of their own account.

- [CAPEC-212: Functionality Misuse:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/212.html)
An adversary leverages a legitimate capability of an application in such a way
as to achieve a negative technical impact.
The system functionality is not altered or modified but used in a way that was
not intended.

- [CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/307.html)
The software does not implement sufficient measures to prevent multiple failed
authentication attempts within in a short time frame,
making it more susceptible to brute force attacks.

- [CWE-645: Overly Restrictive Account Lockout Mechanism:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/645.html)
The software contains an account lockout protection mechanism,
but the mechanism is too restrictive and can be triggered too easily,
which allows attackers to deny service to legitimate users by causing their
accounts to be locked out.

- [OWASP Top 10 A2:2017-Broken Authentication:](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A2-Broken_Authentication)
Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users' identities
temporarily or permanently.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V2.2 General Authenticator Requirements.(2.2.1):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify that anti-automation controls are effective at mitigating breached
credential testing, brute force, and account lockout attacks.
Such controls include blocking the most common breached passwords,
soft lockouts, rate limiting, CAPTCHA, ever increasing delays between attempts,
IP address restrictions,
or risk-based restrictions such as location, first login on a device,
recent attempts to unlock the account, or similar.
Verify that no more than 100 failed attempts per hour is possible on a single
account.

broken authentication and session management.
