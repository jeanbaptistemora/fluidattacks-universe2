## Requirement

The system must never block a user account
after one or several failed authentication attempts.

## Types

- [087. Account lockout](/types/087)

## References

- [CAPEC-2: Inducing Account Lockout:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/2.html)
Many systems implement a password throttling mechanism
that locks an account after a certain number
of incorrect log in attempts.
An attacker can leverage this throttling mechanism
to lock a legitimate user
out of their own account.

- [CAPEC-212: Functionality Misuse:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/212.html)
An adversary leverages a legitimate capability
of an application in such a way
as to achieve a negative technical impact.
The system functionality
is not altered
or modified but used in a way
that was not intended.

- [CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/307.html)
The software does not implement sufficient measures
to prevent multiple failed authentication attempts
within in a short time frame,
making it more susceptible
to brute force attacks.

- [CWE-645: Overly Restrictive Account Lockout Mechanism:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/645.html)
The software contains an account lockout
protection mechanism,
but the mechanism is too restrictive
and can be triggered too easily,
which allows attackers to deny service
to legitimate users by causing their
accounts to be locked out.

- [OWASP Top 10 A2:2017-Broken Authentication:](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A2-Broken_Authentication)
Application functions related to authentication
and session management
are often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys
or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws
to assume other users' identities
temporarily or permanently.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V2.2 General Authenticator Requirements.(2.2.1):](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_4.0-en.pdf)
Verify that anti-automation controls
are effective at mitigating breached
credential testing, brute force
and account lockout attacks.
Such controls include blocking
the most common breached passwords,
soft lockouts, rate limiting, CAPTCHA,
ever increasing delays between attempts,
IP address restrictions,
or risk-based restrictions
such as location, first login on a device,
recent attempts to unlock the account
or similar.
Verify that no more than 100 failed attempts per hour
is possible on a single account.
