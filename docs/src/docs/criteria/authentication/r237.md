## Requirement

The system must guarantee that user actions
are performed by a human
(e.g., registration, authentication and password recovery).
This can be achieved using *CAPTCHA*,
incremental delays or mechanisms
that prevent excessive crawling
and indexing.

## Description

There exist several attacks
that have been automated
or depend on a robot for their execution.
Many of them focus on exploiting vulnerabilities
in authentication forms.
In order to hinder the effectiveness of these attacks,
the system must implement mechanisms
that help ensure
that the entity with
which it is interacting is a human being.

## Types

- [003. Symmetric denial of service](/types/003)

- [047. Automatic information enumeration](/types/047)

- [053. Lack of protection against brute force attacks](/types/053)

- [069. Weak CAPTCHA](/types/069)

## References

- [CAPEC-49: Password Brute Forcing:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/49.html)
In this attack,
the adversary tries every possible value
for a password
until they succeed.
A brute force attack,
if feasible computationally,
will always be successful
because it will essentially go through
all possible passwords given
the alphabet used
(lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, symbols, etc.)
and the maximum length of the password.

- [CWE-287: Improper Authentication:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287.html)
When an actor claims
to have a given identity,
the software does not prove
or insufficiently proves
that the claim is correct.

- [CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/307.html)
The software does not implement sufficient measures
to prevent multiple failed authentication attempts
within a short time frame,
making it more susceptible
to brute force attacks.

- [CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/799.html)
The software does not properly limit the number
or frequency of interactions
that it has with an actor,
such as the number of incoming requests.

- [CWE-804: Guessable CAPTCHA:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/804.html)
The software uses a CAPTCHA challenge,
but the challenge can be guessed
or automatically recognized
by a non-human actor.

- [NERC CIP-007-6. B. Requirements and measures. R5.7:](https://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/Reliability%20Standards/CIP-007-6.pdf)
Where technically feasible,
either limit the number
of unsuccessful authentication attempts;
or generate alerts
after a threshold of unsuccessful authentication attempts.

Application functions related to authentication
and session management
are often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys,
or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws
to assume other users' identities
temporarily or permanently.

Verify that all authentication pathways
and identity management APIs
implement consistent authentication
security control strength,
such that there are no weaker alternatives
per the risk of the application.

Verify that anti-automation controls
are effective at mitigating breached
credential testing, brute force,
and account lockout attacks.
Such controls include blocking
the most common breached passwords,
soft lockouts, rate limiting, *CAPTCHA*
ever increasing delays between
attempts, IP address restrictions,
or risk-based restrictions
such as location,
first login on a device,
recent attempts to unlock the account
or similar.
Verify that no more than 100 failed attempts
per hour is possible on a single account.

Verify the application can detect
and alert on abnormal numbers of requests,
such as by IP, user, total per hour or day,
or whatever makes sense
for the application.

Verify the application will only process
business logic flows
with all steps being processed
in realistic human time,
i.e., transactions are not submitted too quickly.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V11.1 Business Logic Security Requirements.(11.1.8):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)

to protect against excessive calls,
especially if the API is unauthenticated.
