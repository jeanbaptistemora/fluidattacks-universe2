## Requirement

Systems with critical information must implement a component
for biometric verification during the authentication process.

## Description

Biometric authentication relies on the unique biological characteristics of an
individual and serves as an additional security measure for identity assertion.
Critical systems must have specially restrictive access controls.
Therefore, they should include a biometric verification component to increase
the security of the authentication process.
This component, however, should not be the only
identity assertion mechanism in place,
but rather only be a secondary factor.

scheme.

An authenticated protected channel between sensor

and verifier SHALL be established and the sensor or endpoint SHALL be
authenticated prior to capturing the biometric sample from the claimant.

Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users' identities
temporarily or permanently.

factors in conjunction with either something you have and something you know.
