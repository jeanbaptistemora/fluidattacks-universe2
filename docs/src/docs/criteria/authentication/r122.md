The software does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data,
in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

- [CWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/602.html)
The software is composed of a server that relies on the client to implement a
mechanism that is intended to protect the server.

in particular in the context of online services and online identifiers.

Verify that trusted enforcement points such as at access control gateways,
servers, and serverless functions enforce access controls.
Never enforce access controls on the client.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V2.5 Credential Recovery Requirements.(2.5.7):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
