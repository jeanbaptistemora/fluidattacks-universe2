## Requirement

The organization must implement the Single Sign On (*SSO*) process
using standard protocols (e.g., *SAML*).

## Types 

- [006. Authentication mechanism absence or evasion](https://docs.fluidattacks.com/types/006)

- [015. Insecure authentication method](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/015/)

## References

- [CAPEC-115: Authentication Bypass:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/115.html)
An attacker gains access to application, service, or device with the privileges
of an authorized or privileged user by evading or circumventing an
authentication mechanism.
The attacker is therefore able to access protected data without authentication
ever having taken place.

Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users' identities
temporarily or permanently.
