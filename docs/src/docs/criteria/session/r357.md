## Requirement

The system should use securely generated, stateless session tokens that are
validated using digital signatures instead of static *API* secrets.

## References

- [CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/290.html)
This attack-focused weakness is caused by improperly implemented authentication
schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.

- [CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/345.html)
The software does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data,
in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

- [CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html)
The software contains hard-coded credentials,
such as a password or cryptographic key,
which it uses for its own inbound authentication,
outbound communication to external components, or encryption of internal data.

Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users' identities
temporarily or permanently.

Verify that session tokens possess at least 64 bits of entropy.

Verify the application does not treat *OAuth* and refresh tokens — on their
own — as the presence of the subscriber and allows users to terminate
trust relationships with linked applications.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V3.5 Token-based Session Management.(3.5.2):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify the application uses session tokens rather than static *API* secrets
and keys,
except with legacy implementations.

Verify that stateless session tokens use digital signatures, encryption, and
other countermeasures to protect against tampering, enveloping, replay,
null cipher, and key substitution attacks.
