## Requirement

The system must allow users to view and manually log out of any or all active
sessions and devices.

## Description

Session tokens have associated permissions that allow any actor who possesses
them to perform actions in a system.
If a user leaves a session open and loses access to the device on which it
resides,
anyone with access to the device will be able to use that session.
Therefore, the system should allow users to view and log out of any active
session.

Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits
an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization.

Secrets used for session binding SHALL be erased or invalidated by the session
subject when the subscriber logs out.

Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users' identities
temporarily or permanently.
