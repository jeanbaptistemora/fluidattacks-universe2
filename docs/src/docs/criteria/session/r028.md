## Requirement

The system must allow users to view
and manually log out of any
or all active sessions and devices.

## Description

Session tokens have associated permissions
that allow any actor who possesses them
to perform actions in a system.
If a user leaves a session open
and loses access to the device
on which it resides,
anyone with access to the device
will be able to use that session.
Therefore,
the system should allow users
to view and log out of any active
session.

allowing attackers to compromise passwords,

temporarily or permanently.
