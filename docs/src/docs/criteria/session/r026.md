## Requirement

The system must encrypt and verify
client-side session information (**ViewState**).

## Types

- [036. ViewState not encrypted](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/036/)

- [CAPEC-39: Manipulating Opaque Client-based Data Tokens:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/39.html)
In circumstances where an application holds important data client-side in
tokens (cookies, **URL**s, data files, and so forth) that data can be
manipulated.
If client or server-side application components reinterpret that data as
authentication tokens or data
(such as store item pricing or wallet information) then even opaquely
manipulating that data may bear fruit for an Attacker.

- [CAPEC-74: Manipulating State:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/74.html)
The adversary modifies state information maintained by the target software or
causes a state transition in hardware.
If successful, the target will use this tainted state and execute in an
unintended manner.

- [CWE-642: External Control of Critical State Data:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/642.html)
The software stores security-critical state information about its users,
or the software itself, in a location that is accessible to unauthorized
actors.

Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users' identities
temporarily or permanently.
