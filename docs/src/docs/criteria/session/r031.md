## Requirement

When a session is terminated, either manually or automatically,
the system must discard all related data and the session tokens must lose their
validity.

## Description

Session tokens have associated permissions that allow any actor who possesses
them to perform actions in a system.
If session tokens are not removed from the client-side storage nor from the
server,
it increases the chances that they will be compromised.
Furthermore, if they are not invalidated once a session is closed,
the time during which a compromised session can be used maliciously is
increased.

Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits
an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization.

Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users' identities
temporarily or permanently.

Verify that logout and expiration invalidate the session token,
such that the back button or a downstream relying party does not resume an
authenticated session,
including across relying parties.
