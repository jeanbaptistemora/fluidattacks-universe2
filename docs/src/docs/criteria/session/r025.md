## Requirement

The concurrent sessions of a system
must be informed or controlled.

## Description

A system that uses authenticated access sessions
associated with unique users
may allow simultaneous access with the same credentials.
This can pose a risk for the service,
the information and the system users,
by allowing malicious users to interact
simultaneously with the system using a valid user,
thus leading to undetected identity thefts,
unauthorized actions in name of the user (impersonation)
and a loss of traceability of the impersonated user's actions <<r1, ^[1]^>> <<r2, ^[2]^>>.

## Implementation

1. Restrict or remove concurrent sessions:
Configure in the system the option to restrain
the simultaneous connections using the same access credentials,
either from an external authentication system
or from the same system.

## Attacks

1. An attacker logs in simultaneously
using the account of a valid user.

2. An attacker performs actions
without traceability nor authorization.

## Attributes

1. Layer: Application layer
2. Asset: Session management
3. Scope: Integrity
4. Phase: Operation
5. Type of control: Procedure

An adversary attempts to deny legitimate users access to a resource by
continually engaging a specific resource in an attempt to keep the resource
tied up as long as possible.

Authenticating a user, or otherwise establishing a new user session,
without invalidating any existing session identifier gives an attacker the
opportunity to steal authenticated sessions.

an interaction,
typically immediately following authentication.

Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users' identities
temporarily or permanently.
