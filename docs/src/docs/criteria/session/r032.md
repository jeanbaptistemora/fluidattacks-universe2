## Requirement

The system must not expose session **ID**s in **URL**s
and messages presented to the user.

## Description

Session **ID**s are sensitive information that may allow an attacker to steal,
modify and/or destroy information once they obtain one.
Information sent via URL parameters is:

- stored in clear text in the browser history.
 sent to external sites via the referrer *HTTP* header.

- sent to external sites via the search bar
if the browser interprets the *URL* as a query.

- visible to scripts running on the browser that may belong to
third-parties.

Therefore, session **ID**s should not be sent via *URL* parameters,
nor be displayed as messages presented to the user, nor stored in logs.

## Types

- [017. Sensitive information sent insecurely](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/017/)

- [030. Sensitive information sent via URL parameters](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/030/)

Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users' identities
temporarily or permanently.

Many web applications and **API**s do not properly protect sensitive data,
such as financial, healthcare, and *PII*.
Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit card
fraud, identity theft, or other crimes.
Sensitive data may be compromised without extra protection,
such as encryption at rest or in transit, and requires special precautions when
exchanged with the browser.

Verify the application never reveals session tokens in *URL* parameters or error
messages.

Verify that sensitive data is sent to the server in the *HTTP* message body or
headers,
and that query string parameters from any *HTTP* verb do not contain sensitive
data.
