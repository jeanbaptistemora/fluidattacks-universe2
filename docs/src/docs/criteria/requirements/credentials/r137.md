## Requirement

The system must force the change
of temporary passwords,
which are generated by a third party,
after their first use.

## Description

Temporary passwords are often harder
to remember and shared over systems
whose future integrity may not be guaranteed
by the system that created them.
Furthermore,
there is no control over who has access
to the secret besides the third party.
Therefore,
the passwords should be changed
after their first use.
