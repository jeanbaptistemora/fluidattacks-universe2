## Requirement

The system must require passphrases to be
at least 4 words long
and allow them to have
64 characters or more.

## Description

Passwords are identity assertion elements
that can be easily forgotten.
Passphrases are sequences of words
that are longer than passwords
but are also easier to remember.
Thus,
systems should enforce
the use of passphrases
at least 4 words long
and allow them to have
64 characters or more.

## Vulnerabilities

* [035. Weak credential policy](/criteria/vulnerabilities/035)

* [050. Guessed weak credentials](/criteria/vulnerabilities/050)

- [CAPEC-49: Password Brute Forcing:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/49.html)
In this attack,
the adversary tries every possible value
for a password
until they succeed.
A brute force attack,
if feasible computationally,
will always be successful
because it will essentially go through
all possible passwords
given the alphabet used
(lower case letters,
upper case letters,
numbers, symbols, etc.)
and the maximum length
of the password.

- [CAPEC-560: Use of Known Domain Credentials:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/560.html)
An adversary guesses
or obtains (i.e., steals or purchases)
legitimate credentials (e.g., userID/password)
to achieve authentication
and to perform authorized actions
under the guise of an authenticated user
or service.

- [CWE-521: Weak Password Requirements:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/521.html)
The product does not require
that users should have strong passwords,
which makes it easier for attackers
to compromise user accounts.

For password-only authentication
for interactive user access,
either technically or procedurally
enforce the following password parameters:
Password length that is,
at least, 
the lesser of eight characters
or the maximum length supported
by the Cyber Asset;
and minimum password complexity
that is the lesser of three or more
different types of characters
(e.g., uppercase alphabetic,
lowercase alphabetic, numeric,
non-alphanumeric)
or the maximum complexity supported
by the Cyber Asset.

Verifiers SHOULD permit
subscriber-chosen memorized secrets
at least 64 characters in length.

Passwords/passphrases must require
a minimum length
of at least seven characters
or equivalent complexity
and strength.
