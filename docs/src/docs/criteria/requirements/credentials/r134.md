## Requirement

The system must store passwords
with different key derivations (*Salt*).

## Vulnerabilities

- [020. Non-encrypted confidential information](/criteria/vulnerabilities/020)

- [051. Cracked weak credentials](/criteria/vulnerabilities/051)

Encrypt or hash with a salt
all authentication credentials
when stored.

The software uses
a one-way cryptographic hash
against an input
that should not be reversible,
such as a password,
but the software does not also use a salt
as part of the input.

The software uses
a one-way cryptographic hash
against an input
that should not be reversible,
such as a password,
but the software uses a predictable salt
as part of the input.

- [CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/916.html)
The software generates
a hash for a password,
but it uses a scheme
that does not provide a sufficient level
of computational effort
that would make password cracking attacks
infeasible or expensive.

Memorized secrets SHALL be salted
and hashed using a suitable
one-way key derivation function.

Verify that passwords are stored
in a form that is resistant
to offline attacks.
Passwords SHALL be salted and hashed
using an approved one-way key derivation
or password hashing function.
Key derivation and password hashing functions
take a password,
a salt,
and a cost factor as inputs
when generating a password hash.
