## Requirement

The system must force the change
of automatically generated temporary passwords
after their first use.

## Description

Temporary passwords are often harder to remember
and shared over systems
whose future integrity may not be guaranteed
by the system that created them.
Therefore,
users should be forced
to change them
after their first use.

Verify system generated initial passwords
