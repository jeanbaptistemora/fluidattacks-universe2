## Requirement

The system must provide a secure mechanism
to regenerate a user's password.

## Description

Passwords are identity assertion elements
that can be easily lost or forgotten.
Additionally,
they can be leaked
as a result of a user's actions
or a breach in the system.
Thus,
systems should have a secure mechanism
that allows users
to generate a new password
in either of these scenarios.
Furthermore,
none of these mechanisms
should send a recovery secret
in plain text
nor should they reveal the current password.

  that users should have strong passwords,
  which makes it easier for attackers
  to compromise user accounts.

  The software contains a mechanism
  for users to recover
  or change their passwords
  without knowing the original password,
  but the mechanism is weak.
