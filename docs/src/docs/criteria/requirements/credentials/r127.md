## Requirement

Passwords must be hashed
before being stored
using secure hash algorithms
such as *PBKDF2* and *bcrypt*.

## Description

A hash function maps data of arbitrary size
to fixed-size values.
It conceals sensitive information
as it is often not possible
to reverse hashed texts.
Hashing passwords helps prevent unauthorized actors
that may have accessed
the storage system from obtaining them.

  The software generates a hash for a password,
  but it uses a scheme
  that does not provide a sufficient level
  of computational effort
  that would make password cracking attacks
  infeasible or expensive.

  Memorized secrets SHALL be salted and hashed
  using a suitable one-way key derivation function.
