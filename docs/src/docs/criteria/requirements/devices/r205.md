Security misconfiguration
is the most commonly seen issue.
This is commonly a result
of insecure default configurations,
incomplete or ad hoc configurations,
open cloud storage,
misconfigured *HTTP* headers,
and verbose error messages
containing sensitive information.
Not only must all operating systems,
frameworks, libraries,
and applications be securely configured,
but they must be patched/upgraded
in a timely fashion.
