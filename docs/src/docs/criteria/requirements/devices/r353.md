## Requirement

Devices should update their own firmware
upon a predefined schedule.

Deploy automated software update tools
in order to ensure
that the operating systems
are running the most recent security updates
provided by the software vendor.

- [CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/367.html)
The software checks the state
of a resource before using that resource,
but the resourceâ€™s state can change
between the check and the use in a way
that invalidates the results of the check.
This can cause the software
to perform invalid actions
when the resource
is in an unexpected state.

Security misconfiguration
is the most commonly seen issue.
This is commonly a result
of insecure default configurations,
incomplete or ad hoc configurations,
open cloud storage,
misconfigured **HTTP** headers,
and verbose error messages
containing sensitive information.
Not only must all operating systems,
frameworks, libraries,
and applications be securely configured,
but they must be patched/upgraded
in a timely fashion.

Components,
such as libraries,
frameworks,
and other software modules,
run with the same privileges
as the application.
If a vulnerable component
is exploited,
such an attack can facilitate
serious data loss or server takeover.
Applications and **API**s using components
with known vulnerabilities
may undermine application defenses
and enable various attacks
and impacts.

Verify that the firmware update process
is not vulnerable to time-of-check
vs time-of-use attacks.

can perform automatic firmware updates
upon a predefined schedule.

Verify that all high-value business logic flows,
including authentication,
session management and access control,
are thread safe and resistant
to time-of-check
and time-of-use race conditions.

Verify the application does not suffer
from "time of check to time of use"
(**TOCTOU**) issues
or other race conditions
for sensitive operations.
