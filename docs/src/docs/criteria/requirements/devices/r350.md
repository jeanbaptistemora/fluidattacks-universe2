## Requirement

The system should enable
memory protection mechanisms,
such as **ASLR** and **DEP**.

The product does not use
or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism
that provides sufficient defense
against directed attacks
against the product.

- [CWE-1233: Improper Hardware Lock Protection for Security Sensitive Controls:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1233.html)
The product implements
a register lock bit protection feature
that permits security sensitive controls
to modify the protected configuration.

Security misconfiguration
is the most commonly seen issue.
This is commonly a result
of insecure default configurations,
incomplete or ad hoc configurations,
open cloud storage, misconfigured **HTTP** headers,
and verbose error messages
containing sensitive information.
Not only must all operating systems,
frameworks, libraries,
and applications be securely configured,
but they must be patched/upgraded
in a timely fashion.

Verify that memory protection controls
such as **ASLR** and **DEP**
are enabled by the embedded/**IoT** operating system,
if applicable.
