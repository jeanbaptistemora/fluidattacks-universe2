## Requirement

Devices should have mechanisms
that protect their firmware (anti-rollback)
from being downgraded.

## References

- [CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/693.html)
The product does not use
or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism
that provides sufficient defense
against directed attacks
against the product.

- [Algorithm Downgrade:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/757.html)
A protocol or its implementation
supports interaction between multiple actors
and allows those actors to negotiate
which algorithm should be used
as a protection mechanism
such as encryption or authentication,
but it does not select the strongest algorithm
that is available to both parties.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 Appendix C: Internet of Things Verification Requirements.(C.22):](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_4.0-en.pdf)
Verify that the device cannot be downgraded
to old versions (anti-rollback)
of valid firmware.
