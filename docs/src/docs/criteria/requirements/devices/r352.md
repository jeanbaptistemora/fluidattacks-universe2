## Requirement

Developers should implement
and enable trusted execution if it is available
on the deviceâ€™s System-on-Chip (**SoC**) or **CPU**.

The product does not use
or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism
that provides sufficient defense
against directed attacks
against the product.

- [CWE-1233: Improper Hardware Lock Protection for Security Sensitive Controls:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1233.html)
The product implements
a register lock bit protection feature
that permits security sensitive controls
to modify the protected configuration.

Security misconfiguration
is the most commonly seen issue.
This is commonly a result
of insecure default configurations,
incomplete or ad hoc configurations,
open cloud storage,
misconfigured HTTP headers,
and verbose error messages
containing sensitive information.
Not only must all operating systems,
frameworks, libraries,
and applicationscbe securely configured,
but they must be patched/upgraded
in a timely fashion.

Verify that trusted execution
is implemented and enabled,
if available on the device SoC or CPU.
