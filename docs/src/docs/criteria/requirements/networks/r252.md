Security misconfiguration
is the most commonly seen issue.
This is commonly a result
of insecure default configurations, incomplete
or ad hoc configurations,
open cloud storage,
misconfigured **HTTP** headers,
and verbose error messages
containing sensitive information.
Not only must all operating systems,
frameworks, libraries,
and applications be securely configured,
but they must be patched/upgraded
in a timely fashion.

Use strong cryptography
and security protocols
to safeguard sensitive cardholder data
during transmission over open,
public networks.
The protocol in use
only supports secure versions
or configurations.

- [PCI DSS v3.2.1 - Requirement 4.1.1:](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI_DSS_v3-2-1.pdf)
Ensure wireless networks
transmitting cardholder data
or connected to the cardholder data environment,
use industry best practices
to implement strong encryption
for authentication and transmission.
