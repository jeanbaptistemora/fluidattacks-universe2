## Requirement

The system must log
the exact occurrence time
(date, hour, seconds, milliseconds and time zone)
for each exceptional
and security event.

## Description

Event logs
must contain the exact time of occurrence
in order to allow backtracking
in an investigation.

## Implementation

1. Once all the events
to be logged are defined,
the system must be configured
so that these logs contain the date,
hour, seconds, milliseconds
and time zone of the event occurrence.

## Attacks

In a security incident scenario,
event time and duration
cannot be clearly identified
due to the lack of detail in log records.

## Attributes

- Layer: Application layer

- Asset: Logs

- Scope: Responsibility

- Phase: Operation

- Type of control: Procedure

Enable system logging
to include detailed information
such as an event source,
date, user, timestamp,
source addresses, destination addresses,
and other useful elements.

- [CWE-778: Insufficient Logging:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/778.html)
When a security-critical event occurs,
the software either does not record the event
or omits important details
about the event when logging it.

Insufficient logging and monitoring,
coupled with missing
or ineffective integration
with incident response,
allows attackers to further attack systems,
maintain persistence,
pivot to more systems,
and tamper, extract,
or destroy data.

are synchronized to the correct time

for each event: user identification,
type of event, date and time,
success or failure indication,
origination of event,
and identity or name of affected data,
system component, or resource.
