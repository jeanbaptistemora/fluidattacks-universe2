- [CAPEC-113: API Manipulation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/113.html)
An adversary manipulates the use
or processing of an Application Programming Interface (*API*)
resulting in an adverse impact
upon the security of the system
implementing the *API*.
This can allow the adversary
to execute functionality not intended
by the *API* implementation,
possibly compromising the system
which integrates the *API*.

- [CAPEC-116: Excavation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html)
An adversary actively probes
the target in a manner
that is designed to solicit information
that could be leveraged
for malicious purposes.
This is achieved by exploring the target
via ordinary interactions
for the purpose of gathering intelligence
about the target,
or by sending data
that is syntactically invalid
or non-standard in an attempt
to produce a response
that contains the desired data.

- [CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/209.html)
The software generates an error message
that includes sensitive information
about its environment,
users or associated data.

- [CWE-210: Self-generated Error Message Containing Sensitive Information:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/210.html)
The software identifies an error condition
and creates its own diagnostic
or error messages
that contain sensitive information.

- [CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/497.html)
The application does not properly prevent
sensitive system-level information
from being accessed by unauthorized actors
who do not have the same level
of access to the underlying system
as the application does.

- [CWE-1269: Product Released in Non-Release Configuration:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1269.html)
The product released to market
is released in pre-production
or manufacturing configuration.

Security misconfiguration
is the most commonly seen issue.
This is commonly a result
of insecure default configurations,
incomplete or ad hoc configurations,
open cloud storage,
misconfigured *HTTP* headers,
and verbose error messages
containing sensitive information.
Not only must all operating systems,
frameworks, libraries,
and applications be securely configured,
but they must be patched/upgraded
in a timely fashion.

Verify that application layer
debugging interfaces such *USB*, *UART*,
and other serial variants
are disabled or protected
by a complex password.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 Appendix C: Internet of Things Verification Requirements.(C.26):](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_4.0-en.pdf)
Verify that only micro controllers
that support disabling debugging interfaces
(e.g., *JTAG*, *SWD*) are used.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 Appendix C: Internet of Things Verification Requirements.(C.4):](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_4.0-en.pdf)
Verify that on-chip debugging interfaces
such as *JTAG* or *SWD* are disabled
or that an available protection mechanism
is enabled and configured appropriately.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 Appendix C: Internet of Things Verification Requirements.(C.18):](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_4.0-en.pdf)
Verify security controls
are in place to hinder firmware reverse engineering
(e.g., removal of verbose debugging symbols).

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V7.4 Error Handling.(7.4.1)](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_4.0-en.pdf)
Verify that a generic message
is shown when an unexpected
or security sensitive error occurs,
potentially with a unique ID
which support personnel
can use to investigate.

Verify that web or application server
and application framework debug modes
are disabled in production
to eliminate debug features,
developer consoles,
and unintended security disclosures.
