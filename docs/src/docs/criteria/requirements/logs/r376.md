- [CIS Controls. 6.3 Enable Detailed Logging:](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/)
Enable system logging
to include detailed information
such as an event source,
date, user, timestamp,
source addresses, destination addresses,
and other useful elements.

- [CWE-223: Omission of Security-relevant Information:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/223.html)
The application does not record or display
information that would be important
for identifying the source
or nature of an attack,
or determining if an action is safe.

- [CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532.html)
Information written to log files
can be of a sensitive nature
and give valuable guidance to an attacker
or expose sensitive user information.

- [CWE-778: Insufficient Logging:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/778.html)
When a security-critical event occurs,
the software either does not record the event
or omits important details
about the event when logging it. 

- [ISO 27001:2013. Annex A - 12.4.1:](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:54534:en)
Store, maintain
and regularly review records
of user activities,
exceptions, failures
and information security events.

Insufficient logging and monitoring,
coupled with missing
or ineffective integration
with incident response,
allows attackers to further attack systems,
maintain persistence,
pivot to more systems,
and tamper, extract,
or destroy data.

Verify that a common logging format
and approach is used across the system.

includes necessary information
that would allow for a detailed investigation
of the timeline
when an event happens.
