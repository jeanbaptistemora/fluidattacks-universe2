## Requirement

Symmetric encryption
should use a random IV (Initialization Vector)
which should have the same length
of the encryption key.

## Vulnerabilities

- [052. Insecure encryption algorithm](/criteria/vulnerabilities/052)

## References

- [CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/330.html)
The software uses
insufficiently random numbers
or values in a security context
that depends on unpredictable numbers.

- [CWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV):](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1204.html)
The product uses
a cryptographic primitive
that uses an Initialization Vector (IV),
but the product does not generate IVs
that are sufficiently unpredictable
or unique according
to the expected cryptographic requirements
for that primitive.

for management of cryptographic keys
and that a cryptographic key lifecycle follows
a key management standard
such as **NIST SP 800-57**.
