title: Disable insecure TLS versions
sidebar_label: Disable insecure TLS versions

## Requirement

The system must disable out-of-date
or insecure versions of **SSL**
and **TLS** protocols,
algorithms and ciphers.

## Descriptions

All communications between the client
and the server should take place over channels
that are protected and encrypted.
In order to guarantee this, 
out-of-date or insecure protocols
such as **SSLv2**, **SSLv3**,
or **TLS** 1.0
and **TLS** 1.1 should be disabled. 
The latest version of TLS
should be used
and communications
should not be allowed
to fall back on insecure
or unencrypted protocols.

## References

- [CAPEC-94: Man in the Middle Attack:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html)
This type of attack targets the communication
between two components
(typically client and server).
The attacker places themself
in the communication channel
between the two components.
Whenever one component attempts
to communicate with the other
(data flow, authentication challenges, etc.),
the data first goes to the attacker,
who has the opportunity
to observe or alter it,
and it is then passed on
to the other component
as if it was never observed.

- [CAPEC-117: Interception:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/117.html)
An adversary monitors data streams to
or from the target
for information gathering purposes.
This attack may be undertaken
to solely gather sensitive information
or to support a further attack
against the target.
This attack pattern
can involve sniffing network traffic
as well as other types
of data streams (e.g., radio).

- [CAPEC-212: Functionality Misuse:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/212.html)
An adversary leverages
a legitimate capability of an application
in such a way as to achieve
a negative technical impact.
The system functionality
is not altered or modified
but used in a way
that was not intended.

- [CAPEC-216: Communication Channel Manipulation:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/216.html)
An adversary manipulates a setting
or parameter on communications channel
in order to compromise its security.
This can result in information exposure,
insertion/removal of information
from the communications stream,
and/or potentially system compromise.

- [CAPEC-272: Protocol Manipulation:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/272.html)
An adversary subverts
a communications protocol
to perform an attack.
This type of attack targets
invalid assumptions
that may be inherent
in implementers of the protocol,
incorrect implementations of the protocol,
or vulnerabilities
in the protocol itself.

- [CAPEC-594: Traffic Injection:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/594.html)
An adversary injects traffic
into the targetâ€™s network connection.
The adversary is therefore able
to degrade
or disrupt the connection,
and potentially modify the content.

- [CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html)
The software transmits sensitive
or security-critical data in cleartext
in a communication channel
that can be sniffed
by unauthorized actors.

- [CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/326.html)
The software stores
or transmits sensitive data
using an encryption scheme
that is theoretically sound,
but is not strong enough
for the level of protection required.

- [Algorithm Downgrade:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/757.html)
A protocol or its implementation
supports interaction between multiple actors
and allows those actors
to negotiate which algorithm
should be used
as a protection mechanism
such as encryption or authentication,
but it does not select
the strongest algorithm
that is available to both parties.

Many web applications and **APIs**
do not properly protect sensitive data,
such as financial,
healthcare and **PII**.
Attackers may steal
or modify such weakly protected data
to conduct credit card fraud,
identity theft or other crimes.
Sensitive data may be compromised
without extra protection,
such as encryption at rest
or in transit,
and requires special precautions
when exchanged with the browser.

cannot be downgraded to old versions
(anti-rollback) of valid firmware.

that only strong algorithms,
ciphers and protocols are enabled,

algorithms, ciphers,

such as **SSLv2**, **SSLv3**,
or **TLS** 1.0 and **TLS** 1.1.
The latest version of **TLS**
should be the preferred cipher suite.

The server must not fall back
to insecure or unencrypted protocols.
