## Requirement

The system's private asymmetric
or symmetric keys
must be protected
and should not be exposed.

## Description

The system's cryptographic keys
are essential
for maintaining the confidentiality
and integrity of transactions
and communications.
Their exposure
may cause business information leakages,
loss of data integrity
and loss of trust due to the inability
to differentiate server traffic
from malicious traffic.
Therefore,
these keys must be
protected and managed
following industry-verified standards.

  The use of a hard-coded cryptographic key
  significantly increases
  the possibility that encrypted data
  may be recovered.

- [CWE-322: Key Exchange without Entity Authentication:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/322.html)
  The software performs
  a key exchange with an actor
  without verifying
  the identity of that actor.

  Nonces should be used
  for the present occasion
  and only once.

- [CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/522.html)
  The product transmits
  or stores authentication credentials,
  but it uses an insecure method
  that is susceptible to unauthorized interception
  and/or retrieval.

  Many web applications and **API**s
  do not properly protect sensitive data,
  such as financial, healthcare,
  and *PII*.
  Attackers may steal
  or modify such weakly protected data
  to conduct credit card fraud,
  identity theft, or other crimes.
  Sensitive data may be compromised
  without extra protection,
  such as encryption
  at rest or in transit,
  and requires special precautions
  when exchanged with the browser.
