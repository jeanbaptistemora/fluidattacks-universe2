## Requirement

Each individual device must have
unique cryptographic keys
and certificates.

The software stores
or transmits sensitive data using
an encryption scheme
that is theoretically sound,
but is not strong enough
for the level of protection required.

The software uses
insufficiently random numbers
or values in a security context
that depends on unpredictable numbers.

Verify that the challenge nonce
is at least 64 bits in length,
and statistically unique
or unique over the lifetime
of the cryptographic device.

Verify that nonces, initialization vectors,
and other single use numbers must not be used
more than once with a given encryption key.
The method of generation
must be appropriate
for the algorithm being used.
