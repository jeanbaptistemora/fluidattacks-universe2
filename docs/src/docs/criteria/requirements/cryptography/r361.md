## Requirement

The system’s cryptographic keys must be replaced
after a defined period of time,
after having produced
a certain amount of cipher-text
or after its integrity has been weakened, e.g.,
when an employee
with knowledge of a key leaves
or when it is believed to have been compromised.

## Description

The system’s cryptographic keys
are essential for maintaining
the confidentiality and integrity
of transactions and communications.
In order to mitigate
their decreased effectiveness over time
and any possible loss
of their integrity,
they should be replaced often.

The product uses a cryptographic key
or password past its expiration date,
which diminishes its safety significantly
by increasing the timing window
for cracking attacks
against that key.

The software stores
or transmits sensitive data using
an encryption scheme
that is theoretically sound,
but is not strong enough
for the level of protection required.

are replaceable and are part
of a well-defined process
to re-encrypt sensitive data.

is at least 64 bits in length,

Fully document
and implement all key-management processes
and procedures for cryptographic keys
including cryptographic key changes
for keys that have reached the end
of their cryptoperiod.
For example,
after a defined period of time has passed
and/or after a certain amount of cipher-text
has been produced by a given key.

Fully document and implement
all key-management processes
and procedures for cryptographic keys
including retirement or replacement
(for example, archiving, destruction, and/or revocation)
of keys as deemed necessary
when the integrity of the key
has been weakened,
or keys are suspected
of being compromised.
