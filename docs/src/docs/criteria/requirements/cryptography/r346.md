## Requirement

The system should use initialization vectors,
nonces and other single use numbers only once
with a given encryption key.

## Descriptions

The system’s cryptographic keys
are essential for maintaining
the confidentiality and integrity
of transactions and communications.
Some encryption mechanisms
use initialization vectors
to reduce the chances
that a message will be decrypted.
These vectors should be generated
using cryptographically secure
random number generators
and should only be used once
with a given encryption key.

  and other single use numbers
  must not be used more than once
  with a given encryption key.
  The method of generation
  must be appropriate

  are intended to be not guessable
