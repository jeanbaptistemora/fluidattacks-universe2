## Requirement

The asymmetric encryption mechanism
must use a minimum key size of **2048 bits**.

An attacker, armed with the cipher text
and the encryption algorithm used,
performs an exhaustive (brute force) search
on the key space
to determine the key
that decrypts the cipher text
to obtain the plaintext.
