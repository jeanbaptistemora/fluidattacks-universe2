## Requirement

The system must use stable,
tested and up-to-date versions
of third-party components.

## Description

1. The organization must ensure
that the version of all of its products
and the products provided by third-parties
is up to date,
stable and tested.
This reduces the risk
of including vulnerabilities reported
in previous versions.

2. When a product changes its version,
the implemented improvements
must be checked to verify if there were fixes
or new controls related to
recently discovered vulnerabilities.

## Implementation

1. Identify all the products
that compose the technology stack,
including operating systems,
versions, dependencies,
and logical and physical authentication features.
This inventory must be constantly updated.

2. Monitor the security of all
identified components in public databases,
implementing alerts when public vulnerabilities
are disclosed for the products used
by the organization
and determining the affectation level caused
by the reported vulnerabilities.

3. Apply the necessary updates
taking into account the vulnerability type,
the affected components
and its risk classification
within the organization.

4. Define security policies
for the used components,
requiring updated versions,
specific software,
ethical hacking and product licenses.
Include internal policies
to disable unused features
and update default settings
that may pose a risk to the organization.

## Attacks

- An attacker obtains
technical information about a specific product.
If the service/software is out of date,
there could be public exploits designed
to attack known vulnerabilities present
in the in-use version of the product.

## Attributes

is running the most recent security updates
provided by the software vendor.

Components, such as libraries,
frameworks,
and other software modules,
run with the same privileges
as the application.
If a vulnerable component is exploited,
such an attack
can facilitate serious data loss
or server takeover.
Applications and **API**s
using components with known vulnerabilities
may undermine application defenses
and enable various attacks and impacts.
