- [CAPEC-115: Authentication Bypass:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/115.html)
An attacker gains access to application,
service or device
with the privileges of an authorized or privileged user
by evading or circumventing an authentication mechanism.
The attacker is therefore able
to access protected data
without authentication ever having taken place.
