- [CAPEC-242: Code Injection:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/242.html)
An adversary exploits a weakness
in input validation on the target
to inject new code into that
which is currently executing.

- [CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html)
The product does not validate
or incorrectly validates input
that can affect the control flow
or data flow of a program.

- [CWE-173: Improper Handling of Alternate Encoding:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/173.html)
The software does not properly handle
when an input uses an alternate encoding
that is valid for the control sphere
to which the input is being sent.

Verify that output encoding
is relevant for the interpreter
and context required.
For example,
use encoders specifically for *HTML* values,
*HTML* attributes, JavaScript, URL Parameters,
*HTTP* headers, *SMTP*,
and others as the context requires,
especially from untrusted inputs
(e.g., names with Unicode or apostrophes,
such as ねこ or O'Hara).

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V14.4 HTTP Security Headers Requirements.(14.4.1):](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_4.0-en.pdf)
Verify that every *HTTP* response
contains a content type header
specifying a safe character set
(e.g., *UTF-8*, **ISO 8859-1**).
