## Requirement

The source code
must contain functions, methods
or fragments of code
with a ciclomatic complexity (McCabe)
lower than 20.

## Description

The use of McCabe ciclomatic complexity
help to measure how complex a source code is
regardless of the programming language.
This software metric is based on graph theory.
When the code has a high level of complexity,
it will be harder to analyze,
understand and maintain,
therefore,
the time and effort needed
to find and fix vulnerabilities
will increase substantially.

## Vulnerabilities

- [070. Inappropriate coding practices](/criteria/vulnerabilities/070)

## References

- [CWE-1120: Excessive Code Complexity:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1120.html)
The code is too complex,
as calculated using a well-defined,
quantitative measure.

- [CWE-1121: Excessive McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1121.html)
The code contains McCabe cyclomatic complexity
that exceeds a desirable maximum.
