## Requirement

System source code must be implemented
in a stable, updated, tested
and free of known vulnerabilities version
of the chosen programming language.

- [CAPEC-123: Buffer Manipulation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/123.html)
An adversary
manipulates an application's interaction
with a buffer in an attempt to read
or modify data they shouldn't have access to.
Buffer attacks
are distinguished in that
it is the buffer space itself
that is the target of the attack
rather than any code responsible
for interpreting the content of the buffer.

- [CAPEC-129: Pointer Manipulation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/129.html)
This attack pattern
involves an adversary manipulating a pointer
within a target application
resulting in the application accessing
an unintended memory location.
This can result in the crashing of the application or,
for certain pointer values,
access to data that would not normally be possible
or the execution of arbitrary code.

- [CAPEC-131: Resource Leak Exposure:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/131.html)
An adversary utilizes a resource leak on the target
to deplete the quantity of the resource available
to service legitimate requests.
Resource leaks most often
come in the form of memory leaks
where memory is allocated
but never released after it has served its purpose,
however,
theoretically,
any other resource that can be reserved
can be targeted if the target fails
to release the reservation
when the reserved resource block is no longer needed.

- [CIS Controls. 18.1 Establish Secure Coding Practices:](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/)
Establish secure coding practices
appropriate to the programming language
and development environment being used.

- [CWE-120: Classic Buffer Overflow:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html)
The program copies an input buffer
to an output buffer
without verifying that the size of the input buffer
is less than the size of the output buffer,
leading to a buffer overflow.

Components, such as libraries, frameworks,
and other software modules,
run with the same privileges as the application.
If a vulnerable component is exploited,
such an attack
can facilitate serious data loss
or server takeover.
Applications and **API**s
using components with known vulnerabilities
may undermine application defenses
and enable various attacks and impacts.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 Appendix C: Internet of Things Verification Requirements.(C.11):](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_4.0-en.pdf)
Verify that any use of banned *C* functions
are replaced with the appropriate safe equivalent functions.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V5.4 Memory, String, and Unmanaged Code Requirements.(5.4.1):](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_4.0-en.pdf)
Verify that the application uses memory-safe string,
safer memory copy and pointer arithmetic
to detect or prevent stack, buffer,
or heap overflows.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V14.2 Dependency.(14.2.1):](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_4.0-en.pdf)
Verify that all components are up to date,
preferably using a dependency checker
during build or compile time.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V14.2 Dependency.(14.2.4):](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_4.0-en.pdf)
Verify that third party components
come from pre-defined, trusted
and continually maintained repositories.

- [PCI DSS v3.2.1 - Requirement 6.2:](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI_DSS_v3-2-1.pdf)
Ensure that all system components and software
are protected from known vulnerabilities
by installing applicable vendor-supplied security patches.
