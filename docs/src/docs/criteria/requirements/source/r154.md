## Requirement

The source code of a system
must not perform functions
other than those specified
in the functional requirements (backdoors).

## Description

Sometimes,
functionalities other than the ones
for which a system was designed
are included during development
to aid the development
and testing processes.
These functions often represent backdoors
because they leave ports exposed
or help in bypassing the authentication
and/or authorization mechanisms.
Therefore,
they should not be part
of the production environment,
as they could become
serious security vulnerabilities.

- [CAPEC-113: API Manipulation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/113.html)
An adversary manipulates the use
or processing of an Application Programming Interface (*API*)
resulting in an adverse impact
upon the security of the system
implementing the *API*.
This can allow the adversary
to execute functionality
not intended by the *API* implementation,
possibly compromising the system
which integrates the *API*.

- [CAPEC-115: Authentication Bypass:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/115.html)
An attacker gains access to application,
service or device with the privileges
of an authorized or privileged user
by evading or circumventing
an authentication mechanism.
The attacker
is therefore able to access protected data
without authentication
ever having taken place.

An attacker modifies a technology,
product or component during a stage
in its manufacture for the purpose of
carrying out an attack against some entity
involved in the supply chain lifecycle.

Any user or system accounts
used to perform penetration testing
should be controlled and monitored
to make sure they are only being used
for legitimate purposes,
and are removed or restored
to normal function
after testing is over.

A trapdoor is a hidden piece of code
that responds to a special input,
allowing its user access to resources
without passing through
the normal security enforcement mechanism.

Verify all code
including third-party binaries,
libraries, frameworks are reviewed
for hardcoded credentials (*backdoors*).

Verify that the application source code
and third party libraries do not contain backdoors,
such as hard-coded
or additional undocumented accounts or keys,
code obfuscation, undocumented binary blobs,
rootkits, or anti-debugging,
insecure debugging features,
or otherwise out of date, insecure,
or hidden functionality
that could be used maliciously if discovered.

Processes must include
removal of test data and accounts

before the system becomes active / goes into production.
