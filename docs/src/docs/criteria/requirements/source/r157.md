## Requirement

The organization
should set its parsers, linters, compilers
and interpreters to run in strict mode.

- [CAPEC-123: Buffer Manipulation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/123.html)
An adversary manipulates an application's interaction
with a buffer in an attempt to read
or modify data they shouldn't have access to.
Buffer attacks are distinguished in that
it is the buffer space itself
that is the target of the attack rather than any code responsible
for interpreting the content of the buffer.

- [CAPEC-129: Pointer Manipulation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/129.html)
This attack pattern involves an adversary
manipulating a pointer within a target application
resulting in the application accessing
an unintended memory location.
This can result in the crashing of the application or,
for certain pointer values,
access to data that would not normally be possible
or the execution of arbitrary code.

- [CAPEC-130: Excessive Allocation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/130.html)
An adversary causes the target
to allocate excessive resources
to servicing the attackers' request,
thereby reducing the resources available
for legitimate services
and degrading or denying services.
Usually,
this attack focuses on memory allocation,
but any finite resource on the target
could be the attacked, including
bandwidth, processing cycles,
or other resources.

- [CWE-120: Classic Buffer Overflow:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html)
The program copies an input buffer
to an output buffer without verifying
that the size of the input buffer
is less than the size of the output buffer,
leading to a buffer overflow.

- [CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)
The software processes an *XML* document
that can contain *XML* entities with **URI**s
that resolve to documents
outside of the intended sphere of control,
causing the product
to embed incorrect documents into its output.

- [OWASP Top 10 A4:2017-XML External Entities (XXE):](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A4-XML_External_Entities_(XXE))
Many older or poorly configured *XML* processors
evaluate external entity
references within *XML* documents.
External entities
can be used to disclose internal files
using the file *URI* handler,
internal file shares, internal port scanning,
remote code execution,
and denial of service attacks.

Security misconfiguration
is the most commonly seen issue.
This is commonly a result
of insecure default configurations,
incomplete or ad hoc configurations,
open cloud storage,
misconfigured *HTTP* headers,
and verbose error messages
containing sensitive information.
Not only must all operating systems,
frameworks, libraries,
and applications be securely configured,
but they must be patched/upgraded in a timely fashion.

Insecure deserialization often leads
to remote code execution.
Even if deserialization flaws
do not result in remote code execution,
they can be used to perform attacks,
including replay attacks, injection attacks,
and privilege escalation attacks.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 Appendix C: Internet of Things Verification Requirements.(C.33):](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_4.0-en.pdf)
Verify that secure compiler flags
such as **-fPIE**, **-fstack-protector-all**,
**-Wl**, **-z,noexecstack**, **-Wl**,
**-z,noexecheap** are configured for firmware builds.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V5.5 Deserialization Prevention Requirements.(5.5.2):](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_4.0-en.pdf)
Verify that the application
correctly restricts *XML* parsers
to only use the most restrictive configuration possible
and to ensure that unsafe features
such as resolving external entities
are disabled to prevent *XXE*.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V14.1 Build.(14.1.2):](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_4.0-en.pdf)
Verify that compiler flags
are configured to enable all available buffer overflow
protections and warnings,
including stack randomization,
data execution prevention,
and to break the build if an unsafe pointer,
memory, format string, integer,
or string operations are found.

in software-development processes
such as buffer overflows.
