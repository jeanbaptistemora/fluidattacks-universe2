## Requirement

All dependencies (third-party software/libraries)
must be explicitly declared (name and specific version)
in a file inside the source code repository.
Their source code must not be directly included
in the repository.

## Description

The usage of third-party software
and libraries is very common in modern applications,
as it greatly reduces the effort required to develop them.
Unfortunately,
this software may introduce vulnerabilities
into the application,
which causes it to require frequent updates.
In order to ease the constant update process,
instead of directly including third-party software source code
in application repositories,
it should merely be referenced
and managed using a package manager.

## Vulnerabilities

- [079. Non-upgradable dependencies](/criteria/vulnerabilities/079)

- [120. Improper dependency pinning](/criteria/vulnerabilities/120)

of the intended control sphere.
