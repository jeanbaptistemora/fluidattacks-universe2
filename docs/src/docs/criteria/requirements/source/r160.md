title: Encode system outputs

## Requirement

The system output must be encoded in the corresponding language (*escaping*).

## Description

System components use structured messages
to communicate with other components.
When these messages include input
from untrusted sources
and this input is not properly escaped,
they become prone
to the insertion of malicious commands.
For this reason,
encoding or escaping must occur
before sending the messages.

- [CAPEC-18: XSS Targeting Non-Script Elements:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/18.html)
This attack is a form of Cross-Site Scripting (*XSS*)
where malicious scripts are embedded in elements
that are not expected to host scripts
such as image tags (`<img>`),
comments in *XML* documents (`<!-CDATA->`), etc.
These tags
may not be subject to the same input validation,
output validation and other content filtering
and checking routines.

- [CAPEC-19: Embedding Scripts within Scripts:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/19.html)
An attack of this type
exploits a programs' vulnerabilities
that are brought on by allowing remote hosts
to execute scripts.
The adversary leverages this capability
to execute their own script
by embedding it within other scripts
that the target software is likely to execute.
The adversary
must have the ability to inject their script
into a script that is likely to be executed.

- [CAPEC-32: XSS Through HTTP Query Strings:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/32.html)
An adversary embeds malicious script code
in the parameters of an *HTTP* query string
and convinces a victim to submit the *HTTP* request
that contains the query string
to a vulnerable web application.
The web application
then procedes to use the values parameters
without properly validation them first
and generates the HTML code that will be executed
by the victim's browser.

- [CAPEC-48: Passing Local Filenames to Functions That Expect a URL:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/48.html)
This attack relies on client side code
to access local files
and resources instead of **URL**s.
When the client browser is expecting a *URL* string,
but instead receives a request for a local file,
that execution is likely to occur in the browser process space
with the browser's authority to local files.

- [CAPEC-130: Excessive Allocation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/130.html)
An adversary causes the target
to allocate excessive resources
to servicing the attackers' request,
thereby reducing the resources available
for legitimate services
and degrading or denying services.
Usually,
this attack focuses on memory allocation,
but any finite resource on the target
ould be the attacked,
including bandwidth, processing cycles,
or other resources.

- [CAPEC-153: Input Data Manipulation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/153.html)
An attacker exploits
a weakness in input validation
by controlling the format, structure,
and composition of data
to an input-processing interface.
By supplying input of a non-standard
or unexpected form an attacker
can adversely impact the security of the target.

Injection flaws,
such as **SQL**, **NoSQL**,
**OS** and *LDAP* injection,
occur when untrusted data is sent
to an interpreter as part of a command
or query.
The attacker's hostile data
can trick the interpreter into executing
unintended commands or accessing data
without proper authorization.

*XSS* flaws occur
whenever an application includes untrusted data
in a new web page without proper validation or escaping,
or updates an existing web page
with user-supplied data using a browser *API*
that can create *HTML* or **JavaScript**.
*XSS* allows attackers to execute scripts
in the victim's browser
which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites,
or redirect the user to malicious sites.
