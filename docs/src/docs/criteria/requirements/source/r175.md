## Requirement

Web pages must be protected
from being embedded in malicious sites (*clickjacking*).

## Description

*Clickjacking* is a malicious technique
often used in phishing attacks.
By using it,
attackers may deceive users and make them perform actions
other than the ones they perceive,
which may cause them to reveal confidential information.
Web servers
can protect pages they host to a great extent
by including headers in their responses
that prevent the pages
from being embedded in malicious sites (e.g., "**X-Frame-Options**").

## Vulnerabilities

- [043. Improperly set HTTP headers](/criteria/vulnerabilities/043)

## References

- [CWE-346: Origin Validation Error:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/346.html)
The software does not properly verify
that the source of data
or communication is valid.

- [CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/451.html)
The user interface (*UI*) does not properly represent
critical information to the user,
allowing the information - or its source -
to be obscured or spoofed.
This is often a component in phishing attacks.

Verify that a suitable *X-Frame-Options*
or **Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors** header
is in use for sites
where content should not be embedded
in a third-party site.
