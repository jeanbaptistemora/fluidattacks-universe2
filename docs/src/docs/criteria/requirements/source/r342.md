## Requirement

The system must validate the content and length
of all request parameters (*GET*, *POST*, cookies, headers, etc.),
as well as their amount.

## Description

Proper data validation
prevents a vast majority of injection attacks.
Its implementation
includes validations of request parameters' content,
length and amount.
This increases the defenses
against *HTTP* parameter pollution attacks
and mass parameter assignment attacks,
and provides countermeasures
to protect against unsafe parameter assignment.

## Vulnerabilities

- [063. Lack of data validation](/criteria/vulnerabilities/063)

## References

- [CAPEC-6: Argument Injection:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/6.html)
An attacker changes the behavior
or state of a targeted application
through injecting data
or command syntax through the targets use
of non-validated and non-filtered arguments
of exposed services or methods.

- [CAPEC-31: Accessing/Intercepting/Modifying HTTP Cookies:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/31.html)
This attack relies on the use of *HTTP* Cookies
to store credentials,
state information and other critical data
on client systems.
There are several different forms of this attack.
The first form of this attack
involves accessing *HTTP* Cookies to mine
for potentially sensitive data contained therein.
The second form
involves intercepting this data
as it is transmitted from client to server.

- [CAPEC-32: XSS Through HTTP Query Strings:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/32.html)
An adversary embeds malicious script code
in the parameters of an *HTTP* query string
and convinces a victim to submit the *HTTP* request
that contains the query string
to a vulnerable web application.
The web application
then procedes to use the values parameters
without properly validation them first
and generates the HTML code that will be executed
by the victim's browser.

- [CAPEC-137: Parameter Injection:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/137.html)
An adversary manipulates the content of request parameters
for the purpose of undermining the security of the target.

- [CAPEC-153: Input Data Manipulation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/153.html)
An attacker exploits a weakness in input validation
by controlling the format, structure,
and composition of data
to an input-processing interface.
By supplying input of a non-standard
or unexpected form an attacker
can adversely impact the security of the target.

- [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)
The product does not validate
or incorrectly validates input
that can affect the control flow
or data flow of a program.

- [CWE-233: Improper Handling of Parameters:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/233.html)
The software stores sensitive information
without properly limiting read
or write access by unauthorized actors.

- [CWE-235: Improper Handling of Extra Parameters:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/235.html)
The software does not handle
or incorrectly handles when the number of parameters,
fields or arguments with the same name
exceeds the expected amount.

- [CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/915.html)
The software receives input
from an upstream component
that specifies multiple attributes,
properties or fields that are to be initialized
or updated in an object,
but it does not properly control
which attributes can be modified.

- [OWASP Top 10 A1:2017-Injection:](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection)
Injection flaws, such as **SQL**, **NoSQL**,
**OS** and *LDAP* injection,
occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter
as part of a command or query.
The attacker's hostile data
can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands
or accessing data without proper authorization.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V5.1 Input Validation Requirements.(5.1.1):](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_4.0-en.pdf)
Verify that the application
has defenses against HTTP parameter pollution attacks,
particularly if the application framework
makes no distinction about the source of request parameters
(*GET*, *POST*, cookies, headers,
or environment variables).

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V5.1 Input Validation Requirements.(5.1.2):](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_4.0-en.pdf)
Verify that frameworks protect against
mass parameter assignment attacks,
or that the application has countermeasures
to protect against unsafe parameter assignment,
such as marking fields private or similar.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V5.1 Input Validation Requirements.(5.1.3):](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_4.0-en.pdf)
Verify that all input (*HTML* form fields, *REST* requests,
*URL* parameters, *HTTP* headers, cookies,
batch files, *RSS* feeds, etc)
is validated using positive validation (*whitelisting*).

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V8.1 General Data Protection.(8.1.3):](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_4.0-en.pdf)
Verify the application minimizes the number of parameters
in a request,
such as hidden fields, *Ajax* variables,
cookies and header values.
