## Requirement

Systems that manage business-critical information
must require digital certificates
from the client.
This must be done especially
during the authentication process.

  Use client certificates
  to authenticate hardware assets
  connecting to the organizationâ€™s
  trusted network.

- [CWE-299: Improper Check for Certificate Revocation:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/299.html)
  The software does not check
  or incorrectly checks the revocation status
  of a certificate,
  which may cause it to use
  a certificate that has been compromised.

- [CWE-521: Weak Password Requirements:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/521.html)
  The product does not require
  that users should have strong passwords,
  which makes it easier for attackers
  to compromise user accounts.

- [ISO 27001:2013. Annex A - 14.1.3:](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:54534:en)
  Protect information included
  in application services transactions
  to avoid partial transmission,
  improper routing,
  unauthorized message modifications,
  unauthorized disclosure
  and unauthorized message duplication
  or replay.

- [NIST 800-63B 5.2.5 Verifier Impersonation Resistance:](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html)
  A verifier impersonation-resistant
  authentication protocol
  SHALL establish an authenticated protected channel
  with the verifier.
  It SHALL then strongly
  and irreversibly bind a channel identifier
  that was negotiated in establishing the authenticated
  protected channel to the authenticator output
  (e.g., by signing the two values together
  using a private key controlled
  by the claimant for which the public key
  is known to the verifier).

  Application functions related to authentication
  and session management
  are often implemented incorrectly,
  allowing attackers to compromise passwords,
  keys, or session tokens,
  or to exploit other implementation flaws
  to assume other users' identities
  temporarily or permanently.
