## Requirement

Critical systems must have synchronized clocks
whose configuration is protected
and comes from industry-accepted sources.

## Description

Systems must properly record exceptional
and security events in protected logs.
This allows administrators to find bugs
and makes it easier for forensics teams
to determine how a system was compromised.
However,
if clocks are not properly synchronized,
it can be very difficult to compare log files
from different systems
in order to establish the event sequence
that led to the security incident.

retrieve time information on a regular basis
so that timestamps in logs are consistent.
