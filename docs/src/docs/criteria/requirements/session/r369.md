Insufficient Session Expiration
is when a web site permits
an attacker to reuse old session credentials
or session IDs for authorization.

The information system automatically terminates
a user session after organization-defined conditions
or trigger events requiring session disconnect.

If authenticators permit users
to remain logged in,
verify that re-authentication occurs periodically
both when actively used
or after an idle period.

Remote-access technologies
are frequent "back doors" to critical resources
and cardholder data.
By disconnecting remote-access technologies
when not in use
(for example, those used to support your systems
by your POS vendor, other vendors, or business partners),
access and risk to networks is minimized.
