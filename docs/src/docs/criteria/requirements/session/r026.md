## Requirement

The system must encrypt and verify
client-side session information (**ViewState**).

## Vulnerabilities

- [036. ViewState not encrypted](/criteria/vulnerabilities/036)

## References

- [CAPEC-39: Manipulating Opaque Client-based Data Tokens:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/39.html)
In circumstances where an application holds
important data client-side in tokens
(cookies, **URL**s, data files, and so forth)
that data can be manipulated.
If client or server-side application components
reinterpret that data as authentication tokens
or data (such as store item pricing
or wallet information)
then even opaquely manipulating that data
may bear fruit for an Attacker.

- [CAPEC-74: Manipulating State:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/74.html)
The adversary modifies state information
maintained by the target software
or causes a state transition in hardware.
If successful,
the target will use this tainted state
and execute in an unintended manner.

- [CWE-642: External Control of Critical State Data:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/642.html)
The software stores
ecurity-critical state information
about its users,
or the software itself,
in a location
that is accessible
to unauthorized actors.

Application functions
related to authentication and session management
are often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers
to compromise passwords,
keys or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws
to assume other users' identities
temporarily or permanently.
