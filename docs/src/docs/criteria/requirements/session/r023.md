## Requirement

The system must terminate a session
if there is a period of inactivity
on the user side of *5* minutes or more.

## Description

A system can leave a session
indefinitely active
if it does not have
an automatic termination mechanism
based on timeout
and the user does not close it manually.

Failure to control timeouts
may allow an attacker
to take advantage of unattended sessions
and execute actions
on behalf of the authenticated user
without their authorization.
This risk can notably increase
its criticality if this is also the behavior
of high-privileged administrator accounts,
since it would affect the integrity,
confidentiality and availability
of the system,
its users and the information it contains.

## Implementation

Set a session timeout:
Depending on the business needs
and/or the company's session management policies,
a timeout must be set
for unattended or idle sessions (*5* minutes recommended).

## Attacks

1. An employee
or anonymous user takes control
of an unattended device
with an active session
without the user's authorization.

1. In a web server,
having several open sessions
during a long period
forces the server to allocate
a considerable amount of memory
for session objects.

## Attributes

1. Layer: Resource layer
1. Asset: Session management
1. Scope: Adherence
1. Phase: Operation
1. Type of control: Procedure
