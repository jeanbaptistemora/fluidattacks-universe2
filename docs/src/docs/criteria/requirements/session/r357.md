## Requirement

The system should use securely generated,
stateless session tokens
that are validated using digital signatures
instead of static *API* secrets.

## References

- [CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/290.html)
This attack-focused weakness
is caused by improperly implemented authentication schemes
that are subject to spoofing attacks.

- [CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/345.html)
The software does not sufficiently verify
the origin or authenticity of data,
in a way that causes it
to accept invalid data.

- [CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html)
The software contains hard-coded credentials,
such as a password or cryptographic key,
which it uses for its own inbound authentication,
outbound communication to external components,
or encryption of internal data.

Application functions related to
authentication and session management
are often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords,
keys or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws
to assume other users' identities
temporarily or permanently.

Verify that session tokens
possess at least 64 bits of entropy.

Verify the application does not treat
*OAuth* and refresh tokens
— on their own —
as the presence of the subscriber
and allows users
to terminate  trust relationships
with linked applications.

Verify the application uses
session tokens rather than
static *API* secrets and keys,
except with legacy implementations.

Verify that stateless session tokens
use digital signatures, encryption,
and other countermeasures to protect against
tampering, enveloping,
replay, null cipher,
and key substitution attacks.
