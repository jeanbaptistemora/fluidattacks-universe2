## Requirement

The concurrent sessions of a system
must be informed or controlled.

## Description

A system that uses authenticated access sessions
associated with unique users
may allow simultaneous access
with the same credentials.
This can pose a risk for the service,
the information and the system users,
by allowing malicious users
to interact simultaneously
with the system using a valid user,
thus leading to undetected identity thefts,
unauthorized actions in name of the user (impersonation)
and a loss of traceability
of the impersonated user's actions <<r1, ^[1]^>> <<r2, ^[2]^>>.

## Implementation

1. Restrict or remove concurrent sessions:
Configure in the system the option to restrain
the simultaneous connections
using the same access credentials,
either from an external authentication system
or from the same system.

## Attacks

1. An attacker logs in simultaneously
using the account of a valid user.

2. An attacker performs actions
without traceability nor authorization.

## Attributes

1. Layer: Application layer
2. Asset: Session management
3. Scope: Integrity
4. Phase: Operation
5. Type of control: Procedure

to keep the resource tied up
as long as possible.

the opportunity to steal authenticated sessions.
