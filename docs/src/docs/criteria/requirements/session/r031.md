## Requirement

When a session is terminated,
either manually or automatically,
the system must discard all related data
and the session tokens
must lose their validity.

## Description

Session tokens have associated permissions
that allow any actor who possesses them
to perform actions in a system.
If session tokens are not removed
from the client-side storage
nor from the server,
it increases the chances
that they will be compromised.
Furthermore,
if they are not invalidated
once a session is closed,
the time during which a compromised session
can be used maliciously
is increased.

invalidate the session token,
