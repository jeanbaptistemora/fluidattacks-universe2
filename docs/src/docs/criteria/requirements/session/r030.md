## Requirement

The system must guarantee
that objects (session id, cookies, etc.) used
in the authentication process
cannot be reused (**replay resistance**).

## Description

In a system,
it is necessary to prevent transmitted information
from being reused by an attacker
to impersonate an authorized user
or server responses.
Therefore,
it is essential to verify the communications
between the users and the system,
thus avoiding a replay of any request
that could affect the confidentiality,
integrity and/or availability
of the system.

## Implementation

In order to prevent this type of impersonation,
there are several options to consider
depending on the context and implementation method.
Some good practices to avoid data reutilization
are listed below:

1. **Cryptographic nonce**:
It consists of numbers that expire after their first use
or after a small lapse of time,
and through which the authenticity of a message
can be verified.
They are often randomized and used in authentication protocols
to ensure that past communications cannot be reused.

1. **Timestamping**:
In order to implement this method,
there must be a clock synchronization
between the client and the server.
The server will only accept messages
with a date and time
within a defined tolerance range.
Thus,
it minimizes the risk of potential attacks
by significantly limiting the time windows
for exploitation.

1. **Session Token**:
In this method,
the server sends a *token* code
which is used by the client
to transform a key
(e.g., applying hash functions
to the key and token combination)
before sending it again to the server
as part of the authentication process.
The server then processes this value,
compares it with the initial token,
and rejects the request
if they do not match.
Thus,
an attacker cannot perform replay attacks
because the token sent by the server
will be different (token generation must be random).

1. **Session Time-out**:
Session objects are invalidated
when the user terminates a session
or when the user surpasses a certain time limit
without posting new requests.

## Attacks

1. Session hijacking
1. Identity impersonation
1. Man in the middle (*MitM*)
