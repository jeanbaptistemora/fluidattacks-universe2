## Requirement

The system must not expose session **ID**s
in **URL**s and messages presented to the user.

## Description

Session **ID**s are sensitive information
that may allow an attacker to steal,
modify and/or destroy information once they obtain one.
Information sent via URL parameters is:

- stored in clear text in the browser history.
 sent to external sites
 via the referrer *HTTP* header.

- sent to external sites via the search bar
if the browser interprets the *URL*
as a query.

- visible to scripts running on the browser
that may belong to third-parties.

Therefore, session **ID**s should not be sent
via *URL* parameters,
nor be displayed as messages
presented to the user,
nor stored in logs.

## Vulnerabilities

- [017. Sensitive information sent insecurely](/criteria/vulnerabilities/017)

- [030. Sensitive information sent via URL parameters](/criteria/vulnerabilities/030)

The product exposes sensitive information
to an actor that is not explicitly authorized
to have access to that information.

The software transmits sensitive

in a communication channel
that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

- [CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/598.html)
The web application uses
the *HTTP* *GET* method to process a request
and includes sensitive information
in the query string of that request.

Application functions related to
authentication and session management
are often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords,
keys or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws
to assume other users' identities
temporarily or permanently.

Many web applications and **API**s
do not properly protect sensitive data,
such as financial,
healthcare and *PII*.
Attackers may steal
or modify such weakly protected data
to conduct credit card fraud,
identity theft or other crimes.
Sensitive data may be compromised
without extra protection,
such as encryption at rest or in transit,
and requires special precautions
when exchanged with the browser.

is sent to the server in the *HTTP* message body
or headers,
and that query string parameters
from any *HTTP* verb
do not contain sensitive data.
