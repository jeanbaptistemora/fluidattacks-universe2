## Requirement

The response time
with the maximum expected concurrence
must be no more than 5 seconds.

## Description

Response time is a relevant measure
of a systemâ€™s availability
and adaptability to stress.
It is also important
when it comes to usability and reliance.
For these reasons,
the response time
must not surpass 5 seconds
when the number of concurrent users reaches its peak.

- [CAPEC-125: Flooding:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html)
  An adversary consumes the resources
  of a target by rapidly engaging
  in a large number of interactions with the target.
  This type of attack
  generally exposes a weakness
  in rate limiting or flow.
  When successful
  this attack prevents legitimate users
  from accessing the service
  and can cause the target to crash.

- [CAPEC-130: Excessive Allocation:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/130.html)
  An adversary causes the target
  to allocate excessive resources
  to servicing the attackers' request,
  thereby reducing the resources available
  for legitimate services
  and degrading or denying services.
  Usually,
  this attack focuses on
  memory allocation,
  but any finite resource on the target
  could be the attacked,
  including bandwidth,
  processing cycles or other resources.

- [CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)
  The software does not properly control
  the allocation and maintenance
  of a limited resource
  thereby enabling an actor
  to influence the amount of resources consumed,
  eventually leading to the exhaustion
  of available resources.

- [CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html)
  The software allocates a reusable resource
  or group of resources on behalf of an actor
  without imposing any restrictions on the size
  or number of resources
  that can be allocated,
  in violation of the intended security policy
  for that actor.

  an appropriate level of security,
  including the the ability to restore the availability
  and access to personal data
  in a timely manner in the event of a physical

  Verify that query whitelisting
  or a combination of depth limiting and amount
  limiting should be used to prevent **GraphQL**
  or data layer expression denial of service (**DoS**)
  as a result of expensive,
  nested queries.
  For more advanced scenarios,
  query cost analysis should be used.
