## Requirement

The system should only serve files
with extensions within a specific list.

## Description

Servers usually host files that are required
for their operation
or that contain relevant technical information.
These files should not be publicly accessible
because the information they contain
could be leveraged by an attacker
in order to exploit other vulnerabilities.
Configuring the server
to serve only files with a specific extension
helps prevent the unintentional disclosure
of technical information.

  The product’s intended functionality exposes information

  but this information is regarded as sensitive

  Security misconfiguration is the most commonly seen issue.
  This is commonly a result
  of insecure default configurations,
  incomplete or ad hoc configurations,
  open cloud storage,
  misconfigured HTTP headers and verbose error messages
  containing sensitive information.
  Not only must all operating systems,
  frameworks, libraries
  and applications be securely configured,
  but they must be patched/upgraded
  in a timely fashion.

  Verify that the application
  protects against reflective file download (**RFD**)
  by validating or ignoring user-submitted filenames
  in a **JSON**, **JSONP**,
  or **URL** parameter,
  the response **Content-Type** header
  should be set to **text/plain**,
  and the **Content-Disposition** header
  should have a fixed filename.

  Verify that the web tier
  is configured to serve only files
  with specific file extensions
  to prevent unintentional information
  and source code leakage.
  For example, backup files (e.g., **.bak**),
  temporary working files (e.g., **.swp**),
  compressed files (**.zip**, **.tar.gz**, etc.)
  and other extensions commonly used by editors
  should be blocked unless required.

  Verify that every **HTTP** response
  contains a content type header specifying
  a safe character set (e.g., **UTF-8**, **ISO 8859-1**).

  Verify that all **API** responses contain
  **Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="api.json"**
  (or other appropriate filename for the content type).
