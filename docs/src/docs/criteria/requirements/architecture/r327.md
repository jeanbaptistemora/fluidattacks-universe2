## Requirement
The server must have a rate limit
to control interaction frequency.

## Description
Several attacks depend on executing a huge amount
of requests from a single host.
For instance,
it is possible to exhaust a serverâ€™s connection pool
with a single machine
by using asynchronous requests,
effectively causing a Denial of Service (**DoS**).
These and other attacks,
such as the ones depending on brute force,
can be thwarted,
or severely hindered,
by limiting the number of requests
that a single host can send to the server
in a short period of time.
Therefore,
server settings should include a rate limit
that considers a regular request flow
between a host and the server.

## References

- [CAPEC-49: Password Brute Forcing:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/49.html)
In this attack,
the adversary tries every possible value
for a password until they succeed.
A brute force attack,
if feasible computationally,
will always be successful because
it will essentially go through
all possible passwords given the alphabet used
(lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers,
symbols, etc.)
and the maximum length of the password.

- [CAPEC-125: Flooding:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html)
An adversary consumes the resources of a target
by rapidly engaging
in a large number of interactions with the target.
This type of attack
generally exposes a weakness
in rate limiting or flow.
When successful
this attack prevents legitimate users
from accessing the service
and can cause the target to crash.

- [CAPEC-130: Excessive Allocation:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/130.html)
An adversary causes the target
to allocate excessive resources
to servicing the attackers' request,
thereby reducing the resources available
for legitimate services
and degrading or denying services.
Usually,
this attack focuses on memory allocation,
but any finite resource on the target
could be the attacked,
including bandwidth, processing cycles,
or other resources.

- [CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html)
The software allocates a reusable resource
or group of resources on behalf of an actor
without imposing any restrictions on the size
or number of resources
that can be allocated,
in violation of the intended security policy
for that actor.

- [CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/799.html)
The software does not properly limit the number
or frequency of interactions
that it has with an actor,
such as the number of incoming requests.

Verify that anti-automation controls
are effective at mitigating breached credential testing,
brute force,
and account lockout attacks.
Such controls
include blocking the most common breached passwords,
soft lockouts, rate limiting, CAPTCHA,
ever increasing delays between attempts,
IP address restrictions, 
or risk-based restrictions
such as location,
first login on a device,
recent attempts to unlock the account,
or similar.
Verify that no more than 100 failed attempts per hour
is possible on a single account.
