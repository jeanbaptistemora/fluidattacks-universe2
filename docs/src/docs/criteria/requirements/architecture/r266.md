## Requirement

The organization must disable
or carefully control the insecure functions
of a system (system hardening).

## Description

Sometimes,
platforms include functionalities
that are not required
or could be harmful for some applications
built on top of or residing in them.
Other times,
applications are developed
including functionalities
that allow actions
that could be considered insecure.
All these functionalities
should be disabled
or otherwise controlled to prevent them
from compromising the systemâ€™s security.
Furthermore,
the system must enforce those controls
on trusted enforcement points
such as access control gateways, severs
and serverless functions.

- [CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/749.html)
The software provides an Applications Programming Interface (API)

for interaction with external actors,
but the interface includes a dangerous method
or function that is not properly restricted.

Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do
are often not properly enforced.
Attackers can exploit these flaws
to access unauthorized functionality
and/or data,
such as access other users' accounts,
view sensitive files,
modify other users' data,
change access rights, etc.

Security misconfiguration is the most commonly seen issue.
This is commonly a result
of insecure default configurations,
incomplete or ad hoc configurations,
open cloud storage,
misconfigured **HTTP** headers
and verbose error messages
containing sensitive information.
Not only must all operating systems,
frameworks, libraries
and applications be securely configured,
but they must be patched/upgraded in a timely fashion.
