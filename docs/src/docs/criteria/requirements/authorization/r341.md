## Requirement

The system should set minimal or no permissions
for new users/roles
and users/roles should not receive access
to new features
until it is explicitly granted.

## Description

Systems should have a set of roles
with different levels of privilege
to access resources.
The privileges of each role
must be clearly defined
and the role of each user
should also be clearly stated.
Furthermore,
permissions and access
should be granted using
the principle of **deny by default**.

  An adversary is able to exploit features
  of the target
  that should be reserved
  for privileged users or administrators
  but are exposed to use by lower
  or non-privileged accounts.
  Access to sensitive information and functionality
  must be controlled
  to ensure that only authorized users
  are able to access these resources.

  An adversary exploits a weakness
  enabling them to elevate their privilege
  and perform an action
  that they are not supposed to be authorized
  to perform.

  Restrictions on what authenticated users
  are allowed to do
  are often not properly enforced.
  Attackers can exploit these flaws
  to access unauthorized functionality
  and/or data,
  such as access other users' accounts,
  view sensitive files,
  modify other users' data,
  change access rights, etc.

  exists whereby new users/roles
