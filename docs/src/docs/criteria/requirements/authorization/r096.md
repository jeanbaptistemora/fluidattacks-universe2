## Requirement

The privileges required by the users
who will access the system must be defined.

## Description

Systems should have a set of roles
with different levels of privilege
to access resources.
The privileges of each role
must be clearly defined
and the role of each user
should also be clearly stated.

In the case that the administrator failed
to specify an Access Control List (*ACL*)
for a particular element,
an attacker may be able to access it with impunity.
An attacker with the ability to access
functionality not properly constrained by **ACL**s
can obtain sensitive information
and possibly compromise the entire application.

- [CAPEC-122: Privilege Abuse:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html)
An adversary is able to exploit features
of the target that should be reserved
for privileged users or administrators
but are exposed to use by lower
or non-privileged accounts.
Access to sensitive information and functionality
must be controlled to ensure
that only authorized users
are able to access these resources.

Restrictions on what authenticated users
are allowed to do
are often not properly enforced.
Attackers can exploit these flaws
to access unauthorized functionality
and/or data,
such as access other users' accounts,
view sensitive files,
modify other users' data,
change access rights, etc.
