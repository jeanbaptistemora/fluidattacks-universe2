## Requirement

The system must not allow system actors
to modify privileges for themselves.

## Description

Systems should have a set of roles
with different levels of privilege
to access resources.
The privileges of each role
must be clearly defined
and the role of each user
should also be clearly stated.
Furthermore,
users should not be allowed
to modify their own privileges,
as this could be leveraged to access
otherwise restricted functionalities
and resources.

  An adversary exploits a weakness
  enabling them
  to elevate their privilege
  and perform an action
  that they are not supposed
  to be authorized to perform.

  A particular privilege, role, capability,

  even when it is assigned
  to the correct entity.

  The software does not properly assign, modify, track,
  or check privileges for an actor,
  creating an unintended sphere of control
  for that actor.

  The software does not perform
  or incorrectly performs an authorization check
  when an actor attempts to access a resource
  or perform an action.

  The system's authorization functionality
  does not prevent one user from gaining access
  to another user's data
  or record by modifying the key value
  identifying the data.

  Restrictions on what authenticated users
  are allowed to do are often not properly enforced.
  Attackers can exploit these flaws
  to access unauthorized functionality
  and/or data,
  such as access other users' accounts,
  view sensitive files,
  modify other users' data,
  change access rights, etc.

  and policy information used

  Verify that the principle of least privilege exists.
  Users should only be able
  to access functions, data files, URLs,
  controllers, services,
  and other resources,
  for which they possess specific authorization.
  This implies protection against spoofing
  and elevation of privilege.
