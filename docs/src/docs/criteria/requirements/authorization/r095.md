## Requirement

The users that will access the system
with administrator or root privileges
must be defined.

## Description

Systems should have a set of roles
with different levels of privilege
to access resources.
The privileges of each role must be clearly defined
and the role of each user
should also be clearly stated.
That includes the set of users
that will have administrator
or root privileges,
as this should not be a default role.

- [CAPEC-122: Privilege Abuse:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html)
An adversary is able to exploit features of the target
that should be reserved
for privileged users or administrators
but are exposed to use by lower
or non-privileged accounts.
Access to sensitive information
and functionality must be controlled
to ensure that only authorized users
are able to access these resources.

enabling them to elevate their privilege
and perform an action
that they are not supposed to be
authorized to perform.

Restrictions on what authenticated users
are allowed to do
are often not properly enforced.
Attackers can exploit these flaws
to access unauthorized functionality
and/or data,
such as access other users' accounts,
view sensitive files,
modify other users' data,
change access rights, etc.

whereby new users/roles start with minimal
or no permissions and users/roles
