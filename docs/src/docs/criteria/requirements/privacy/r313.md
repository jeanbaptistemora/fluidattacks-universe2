## Requirement

The system must inform its users
whenever it can demonstrate its inability
to individually identify them
using the information
it has collected from them.

## Description

Systems usually request information
from their users or collect it based on
their interactions with the application.
Some regulations
related to the collection of personal data
are only applicable
if users can be identified
using this data.
Whenever the system
is unable to individually identify its users
with the data it collects from them,
and it can demonstrate this,
it must inform them of this situation.
