## Requirement

The system must enable its users
to revoke whatever consent they have granted.

## Description

Systems usually request information
from their users or collect it based
on their interactions with the application.
Regulations demand
that none of these collections occur
without the user's consent
and that this consent be demonstrable afterwards.
Regulations
also demand that users be allowed to revoke,
at any given time,
whatever consent they may have granted
regarding the collection and processing
of their information.
