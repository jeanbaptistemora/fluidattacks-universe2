## Requirement

The system must respect the user's chosen value
for the Do Not Track (*DNT*) header.

## Description

Systems usually request information
from their users,
obtain it from third parties
or collect it based on their interactions
with the application.
The *DNT* header holds information
about a user's preference
regarding being tracked
by the websites they visit.
Websites often ignore this header
and proceed to track the user's activities,
which could represent a privacy violation
if no consent is requested.
