## Requirement

The system must notify third parties
when it rectifies or erases shared personal information.

## Description

Systems usually request information
from their users,
obtain it from third parties
or collect it based on their interactions
with the application.
They sometimes share personal information
with third parties
after having requested consent from its owner.
Whenever this information is rectified
or erased upon request from its owner,
the system must notify
said third parties
so that they do the same.
This is also the case
when the user requests 
that the system stop processing their data.

## Exceptions

1. The system must proceed
with the notification unless it is impossible
or involves disproportionate effort.

2. The processing of the personal
information might have archiving purposes
in the public interest.
If the system properly safeguards this information
and if complying with this requirement
seriously impairs these purposes,
this requirement is not applicable.
