## Requirement

The system must request
at least one username and password
from every actor
that tries to authenticate.

## Description

Sometimes systems have information
and other resources that are not considered public.
These resources should be protected
by a secure authentication mechanism
that prevents unauthorized actors
from accessing them.
The authentication mechanism
should request at least a username and a password.

  to assume other users' identities
  temporarily or permanently.

  Verify that communications
  between application components,

  a single vetted authentication mechanism
  that is known to be secure,
  can be extended to include strong authentication,
  and has sufficient logging
  and monitoring to detect account abuse
  or breaches.

  by employing at least a password,
  a passphrase, a token device, a smart card
  or a biometric
  to authenticate all users.
