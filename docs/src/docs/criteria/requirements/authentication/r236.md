  Verify that relying parties specify
  the maximum authentication time to **CSP**s
  and that **CSP**s re-authenticate the subscriber
  if they haven't used a session
  within that period.

  Application functions related to authentication
  and session management are
  often implemented incorrectly,
  allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys,
  or session tokens,
  or to exploit other implementation flaws
  to assume other users' identities
  temporarily or permanently.
