## Requirement

Systems with critical information
must implement a component
for biometric verification
during the authentication process.

## Description

Biometric authentication relies on
the unique biological characteristics
of an individual and serves
as an additional security measure
for identity assertion.
Critical systems must have
specially restrictive access controls.
Therefore,
they should include a biometric verification component
to increase the security
of the authentication process.
This component, however,
should not be
the only identity assertion mechanism in place,
but rather only be a secondary factor.

  Application functions related to authentication
  and session management
  are often implemented incorrectly,
  allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys,
  or session tokens,
  or to exploit other implementation flaws
  to assume other users' identities
  temporarily or permanently.
