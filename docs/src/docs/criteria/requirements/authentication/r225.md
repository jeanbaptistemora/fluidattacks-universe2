## Requirement

System responses to authentication failures
must not indicate which part of the authentication was incorrect.

## Description

Authentication forms are one of the most publicly accessible parts
of an application,
which makes them more susceptible to be attacked.
Most authentication mechanisms
require only a username and a password.
If the responses to authentication attempts indicate
which authentication parameter was incorrect,
attackers may be able to obtain
a list of valid usernames (user enumeration)
that they can use in brute force attacks.
