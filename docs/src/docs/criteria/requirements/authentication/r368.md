  The product behaves differently
  or sends different responses
  under different circumstances
  in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor,
  which exposes security-relevant information
  about the state of the product,
  such as whether a particular operation
  was successful or not

- [CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/204.html)
  The product provides different responses
  to incoming requests in a way
  that reveals internal state information
  to an unauthorized actor
  outside of the intended control sphere.

- [CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/208.html)
  Two separate operations in a product
  require different amounts of time to complete,
  in a way that is observable to an actor
  and reveals security-relevant information
  about the state of the product,
  such as whether a particular operation
  was successful or not.
