## Requirement

The system must require authentication
for all resources,
except for the consultation
or visualization of those
specifically classified as public.

## Description

Sometimes systems have information
and other resources
that are not considered public.
These resources should be protected
by a secure authentication mechanism
that prevents unauthorized actors
from accessing them.

- [CAPEC-1: Accessing Functionality Not Properly Constrained by ACLs:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/1.html)
  In the case that the administrator failed
  to specify an Access Control List
  (*ACL*) for a particular element,
  an attacker may be able to access it with impunity.
  An attacker with the ability to access functionality
  not properly constrained by **ACL**s
  can obtain sensitive information
  and possibly compromise the entire application.

- [CAPEC-36: Using Unpublished Interfaces:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/36.html)
  An adversary searches for and invokes interfaces
  that the target system designers did not intend
  to be publicly available.
  If these interfaces fail to authenticate requests
  the attacker may be able
  to invoke functionality
  they are not authorized for.

- [CAPEC-115: Authentication Bypass:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/115.html)
  An attacker gains access to application, service,
  or device with the privileges
  of an authorized or privileged user
  by evading or circumventing
  an authentication mechanism.
  The attacker is therefore able
  to access protected data without authentication
  ever having taken place.

- [CWE-287: Improper Authentication:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287.html)
  When an actor claims to have a given identity,
  the software does not prove
  or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

- [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html)
  The software does not perform any authentication
  for functionality
  that requires a provable user identity
  or consumes a significant amount
  of resources.

  should be controlled

  Application functions related to authentication
  and session management
  are often implemented incorrectly,
  allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys,
  or session tokens,
  or to exploit other implementation flaws
  to assume other users' identities
  temporarily or permanently.

  Many web applications and **API**s
  do not properly protect sensitive data,
  such as financial, healthcare, and *PII*.
  Attackers may steal
  or modify such weakly protected data
  to conduct credit card fraud,
  identity theft or other crimes.
  Sensitive data may be compromised
  without extra protection,
  such as encryption at rest or in transit,
  and requires special precautions
  when exchanged with the browser.
