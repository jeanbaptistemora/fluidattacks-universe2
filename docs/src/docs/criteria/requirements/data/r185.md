## Requirement

All stored sensitive information
must be encrypted.

## Description

Systems usually store personal data,
i.e., Personally Identifiable Information (*PII*),
medical records, credentials
and other types of sensitive information.
All of these must be encrypted
before being stored
using safe cryptographic mechanisms.
This is also applicable
when personal information must be temporarily stored
in the client-side storage.
The encryption prevents unauthorized actors
that may have accessed the storage system
from obtaining the information.

  a secondary authentication mechanism not integrated
  into the operating system,
  in order to access the information.

  protect personal data stored or transmitted

  Personal data which are,
  by their nature,
  particularly sensitive in relation

  merit specific protection
  as the context of their processing
  could create significant risks

  Many web applications and **API**s
  do not properly protect sensitive data,
  such as financial,
  healthcare and *PII*.
  Attackers may steal
  or modify such weakly protected data
  to conduct credit card fraud,
  identity theft or other crimes.
  Sensitive data may be compromised
  without extra protection,
  such as encryption at rest or in transit,
  and requires special precautions
  when exchanged with the browser.
