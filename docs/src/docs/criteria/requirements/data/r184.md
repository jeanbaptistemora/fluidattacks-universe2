  Many web applications and **API**s
  do not properly protect sensitive data,
  such as financial,
  healthcare and *PII*.
  Attackers may steal
  or modify such weakly protected data
  to conduct credit card fraud,
  identity theft or other crimes.
  Sensitive data may be compromised
  without extra protection,
  such as encryption at rest or in transit,
  and requires special precautions
  when exchanged with the browser.

  Verify that all sensitive data
  created and processed by the application
  has been identified,
  and ensure that a policy is in place
  on how to deal with sensitive data.
