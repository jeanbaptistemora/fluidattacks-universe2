## Requirement

The transmission of sensitive information
and the execution of sensitive functions
must be performed through secure protocols.

## Description

A system can send information
through a non-encrypted channel
using insecure protocols.
The use of these protocols
makes it easier to perform
a man-in-the-middle attack (*MitM*)
to intercept and modify the information.
Examples of such insecure protocols
are *HTTP*, *FTP*, *POP3* and *Telnet*.

## Implementation

1. Deploy applications using *HTTPS*
in the application server:
When using this protocol,
the channel used for the deployment
of web applications is encrypted.
For this,
it is necessary to have
certificates issued
by a valid certifying entity.

1. Use secure services instead of standard services:
When you need to transmit sensitive information
using services
such as *FTP* and *POP3*,
you can enable secure versions
of each protocol or implement protocols
with the same functions
but having communication encryption
such as *SSH*,
*FTPS*, *POP3S* and *TLS*.

## Attacks

1. An attacker with access
to non-encrypted channels perform
a man-in-the-middle (*MitM*) attack
over the vulnerable assets in order
to intercept, obtain
and/or modify the transmitted information.

## References

- [CAPEC-12: Choosing Message Identifier:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/12.html)
This pattern of attack is defined
by the selection of messages distributed
over via multicast
or public information channels
that are intended for another client
by determining the parameter value
assigned to that client.
This attack allows the adversary
to gain access to potentially
privileged information,
and to possibly perpetrate other attacks
through the distribution means
by impersonation.

- [CAPEC-31: Accessing/Intercepting/Modifying HTTP Cookies:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/31.html)
This attack relies on the use
of *HTTP* Cookies to store credentials,
state information
and other critical data on client systems.
There are several different forms of this attack.
The first form of this attack
involves accessing *HTTP* Cookies
to mine for potentially sensitive data
contained therein.
The second form involves
intercepting this data as it is transmitted
from client to server.

- [CAPEC-94: Man in the Middle Attack:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html)
This type of attack targets the communication
between two components
(typically client and server).
The attacker places themself
in the communication channel
between the two components.
Whenever one component attempts
to communicate with the other
(data flow, authentication challenges, etc.),
the data first goes to the attacker,
who has the opportunity
to observe or alter it,
and it is then passed on
to the other component
as if it was never observed.

- [CAPEC-117: Interception:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/117.html)
An adversary monitors data streams t
or from the target
for information gathering purposes.
This attack may be undertaken
to solely gather sensitive information
or to support a further attack
against the target.
This attack pattern
can involve sniffing network traffic
as well as other types
of data streams (e.g., radio).

- [CAPEC-148: Content Spoofing:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/148.html)
An adversary modifies content
to make it contain something other
than what the original content producer intended
while keeping the apparent source
of the content unchanged.

- [CAPEC-216: Communication Channel Manipulation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/216.html)
An adversary manipulates a setting
or parameter on communications channel
in order to compromise its security.
This can result in information exposure,
insertion/removal of information
from the communications stream,
and/or potentially system compromise.

- [CAPEC-594: Traffic Injection:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/594.html)
An adversary injects traffic
into the target's network connection.
The adversary is therefore able to degrade
or disrupt the connection,
and potentially modify the content.
