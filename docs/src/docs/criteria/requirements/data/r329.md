## Requirement

Personal, sensitive and session data
must not be stored in the client-side storage
(*localStorage*, *sessionStorage*,
cookies without security attributes,
mobile device unencrypted storage, etc.).

## Description

Data placed in the *localStorage* persists
after a session is closed
and thus,
any actor with access to the browser
will be able to obtain it.
Furthermore,
data in the *localStorage*
or in the *sessionStorage*
is visible to scripts
that are running on the browser,
and these scripts could belong
to malicious third-parties.
Therefore,
no sensitive or session information
should be stored in the client-side storage.

personal data stored or transmitted

Personal data
shall be processed in a manner

unauthorized or unlawful processing
and against accidental loss,
destruction or damage.

Personal data which are,
by their nature,
particularly sensitive in relation to
fundamental rights and freedoms
merit specific protection
as the context of their processing
could create significant risks
to the fundamental rights

Secrets used for session binding
SHOULD NOT be placed in insecure locations
such as *HTML5* Local Storage
due to the potential exposure
of local storage to cross-site scripting (*XSS*) attacks.

Many web applications and **API**s
do not properly protect sensitive data,
such as financial,
healthcare and *PII*.
Attackers may steal
or modify such weakly protected data
to conduct credit card fraud,
identity theft or other crimes.
Sensitive data may be compromised
without extra protection,
such as encryption at rest
or in transit,
and requires special precautions
when exchanged with the browser.

Verify that data stored
in client side storage (such as *HTML5* local storage,
session storage, **IndexedDB**,
regular cookies or *Flash* cookies)
does not contain sensitive data or *PII*.
