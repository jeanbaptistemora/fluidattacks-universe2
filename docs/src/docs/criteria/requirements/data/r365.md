- [CAPEC-116: Excavation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html)
An adversary actively probes the target
in a manner that is designed
to solicit information
that could be leveraged for malicious purposes.
This is achieved by exploring the target
via ordinary interactions
for the purpose of gathering intelligence
about the target,
or by sending data that is syntactically invalid
or non-standard in an attempt
to produce a response
that contains the desired data.

- [CAPEC-224: Fingerprinting:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/224.html)
An adversary compares output
from a target system to known indicators
that uniquely identify specific details
about the target.
