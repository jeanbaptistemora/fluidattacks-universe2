## Requirement

Environments other than production
should use mock
or automatically generated data.

## Description

Applications usually handle personal
and other types of sensitive information.
This information should not be used
to perform tests
or during development processes,
as it could lead to unintended exposure.
Non-production environments
should use mock data
or data that has been automatically generated.

Many web applications and **API**s
do not properly protect sensitive data,
such as financial,

Attackers may steal

to conduct credit card fraud,
identity theft or other crimes.
Sensitive data may be compromised
without extra protection,
such as encryption at rest
or in transit,

when exchanged with the browser.
