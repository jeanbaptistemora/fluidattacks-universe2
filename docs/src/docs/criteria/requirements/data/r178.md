## Requirement

The system must use digital signatures
to ensure the authenticity
of sensitive information.

## Description

A digital signature
is a cryptographic mechanism
that helps identify the sender of a message,
and guarantee its authenticity and integrity.
It should be used
when dealing with very sensitive information
or with data and resources
that are susceptible
to being affected by third parties.

- [CAPEC-21: Exploitation of Trusted Identifiers:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/21.html)
An adversary guesses,
obtains or "rides"
a trusted identifier (e.g., session ID, resource ID, cookie, etc.)
to perform authorized actions
under the guise of an authenticated user or service.
Attacks on trusted identifiers
take advantage of the fact
that some software accepts user input
without verifying its authenticity.

An attack of this type
exploits vulnerabilities
in client/server communication
channel authentication
and data integrity.
It leverages
the implicit trust a server places
in the client,
or more importantly,
that which the server believes
is the client.

An adversary modifies content
to make it contain something other
than what the original content producer intended
while keeping the apparent source
of the content unchanged.

The software stores or transmits
sensitive data using an encryption scheme
that is theoretically sound,
but is not strong enough
for the level of protection required.

- [CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/345.html)
The software does not sufficiently
verify the origin or authenticity of data,
in a way that causes it
to accept invalid data.

The software does not verify,
or incorrectly verifies,
the cryptographic signature for data.

- [CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/494.html)
The product downloads source code
or an executable from a remote location
and executes the cod
without sufficiently verifying
the origin and integrity
of the code.

Verify that if the application has a client
or server auto-update feature,
updates should be obtained over secure channels
and digitally signed.
The update code must validate
the digital signature of the update
before installing
or executing the update.

Verify that the application
employs integrity protections,
such as code signing
or sub-resource integrity.
The application must not load
or execute code from untrusted sources,
such as loading includes,
modules, plugins, code,
or libraries from untrusted sources
or the Internet.

Verify that the message headers and payload
are trustworthy and not modified
in transit.
Requiring strong encryption
for transport (*TLS* only) may be sufficient
in many cases as it provides
both confidentiality
and integrity protection.
Per-message digital signatures
can provide additional assurance on top
of the transport protections
for high-security applications
but bring with them
additional complexity and risks
to weigh against the benefits.

is signed using *WS-Security*
to ensure reliable transport
between client and service.
