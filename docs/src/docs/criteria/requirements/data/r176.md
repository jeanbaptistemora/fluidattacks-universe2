## Requirement

The system must restrict access
to system objects
that have sensitive content.
It should only allow access
to authorized users.

## Description

Applications usually handle personal
and confidential information,
such as personal identifications,
social security numbers,
credentials and health histories.
This data should be protected
as a fundamental right,
and therefore be stored
and transmitted using secure mechanisms
that prevent access to it
by unauthorized actors.
Furthermore,
the access control model
and role assignment policy
must be implemented
taking these restrictions
into consideration.

Many web applications and **API**s
do not properly protect sensitive data,
such as financial,
healthcare and *PII*.
Attackers may steal
or modify such weakly protected data
to conduct credit card fraud,
identity theft or other crimes.
Sensitive data may be compromised
without extra protection,
such as encryption at rest
or in transit,
and requires special precautions
when exchanged with the browser.

Restrictions on what authenticated users
are allowed to do
are often not properly enforced.
Attackers can exploit these flaws
to access unauthorized functionality
and/or data,
such as access other users' accounts,
view sensitive files,
modify other users' data,
change access rights, etc.

is used whereby the code checks
