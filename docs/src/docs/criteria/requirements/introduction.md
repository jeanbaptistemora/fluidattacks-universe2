## Requirements

**Requirements** allows you to determine
what is tested and what is not,
and find out what is considered a vulnerability.
It is also the basis for determining
how rigorous a pentest was,
based on tested and untested requirements.
The security requirements
are independent of the type of technology being used
and are written as specific
and understandable objectives.
They are the security demands
that you agree to follow and comply with.
Through our hacking services,
we determine if these are met or not.
