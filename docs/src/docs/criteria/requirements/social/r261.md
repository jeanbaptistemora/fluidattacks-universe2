## Requirement

The application must not expose
sensitive information in sections
that are publicly accessible.

## Description

Some applications have sections
such as web pages and endpoints
that are publicly exposed
or do not require
an initiated session to be accessed.
These sections
should contain neither sensitive corporate information
nor users' or employees' personal data.
Furthermore,
corporate sensitive information
should not be exposed
on personal social network accounts either.

  An adversary actively probes the target
  in a manner that is designed to solicit information
  that could be leveraged for malicious purposes.
  This is achieved by exploring the target
  via ordinary interactions
  for the purpose of gathering intelligence
  about the target,
  or by sending data
  that is syntactically invalid
  or non-standard in an attempt to produce
  a response that contains the desired data.

  Many web applications and **API**s
  do not properly protect sensitive data,
  such as financial,
  healthcare and *PII*.
  Attackers may steal
  or modify such weakly protected data
  to conduct credit card fraud,
  identity theft or other crimes.
  Sensitive data may be compromised
  without extra protection,
  such as encryption at rest or in transit,
  and requires special precautions
  when exchanged with the browser.

  Verify that directory browsing
  is disabled unless deliberately desired.
  Additionally,
  applications should not allow discovery
  or disclosure of file
  or directory metadata,
  such as Thumbs.db, .DS_Store, .git
  or .svn folders.
