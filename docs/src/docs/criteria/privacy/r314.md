storing and/or processing their personal data.

## Description

Systems usually request information from their users,
obtain it from third parties or collect it based on their interactions with the
application.
They should have a mechanism that allows users to request confirmation of
whether or not the system is managing their personal information,
even if it was not obtained from the users but from a third party.

## Types

identify the users based on the information collected from them,
this requirement is not applicable.

2. The processing of the personal information might have scientific or
historical research purposes or statistical purposes.
If the system properly safeguards this information and if complying with this
requirement seriously impairs those purposes,
this requirement is not applicable.

3. The processing of the personal information might have archiving purposes
in the public interest.
If the system properly safeguards this information and if complying with this
