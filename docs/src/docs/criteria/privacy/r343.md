## Requirement

The system must respect the user's chosen value for the Do Not Track (*DNT*)
header.

## Description

Systems usually request information from their users,
obtain it from third parties
or collect it based on their interactions with the application.
The *DNT* header holds information about a user's preference regarding being
tracked by the websites they visit.
Websites often ignore this header and proceed to track the user's activities,
which could represent a privacy violation if no consent is requested.
