## Requirement

The system must request the user's consent whenever it will collect any
information about them or their actions.
This consent should not be requested before informing the user about the types
of data that will be collected and the purpose for which they will be
processed.

## Description

Systems usually request information from their users or collect it based
on their interactions with the application.
Regulations demand that none of these collections occur without the user's
consent, that this consent be demonstrable afterwards and that it only be
requested after having informed the user
of the types and purposes of data collection.
Therefore, consent must always be requested in a clear manner
and using easily understandable language
before collecting any personal information.
