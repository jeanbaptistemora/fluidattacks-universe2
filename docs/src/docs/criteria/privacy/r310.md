## Requirement

The system
must request the user's consent
whenever it will collect any information
about them or their actions.
This consent should not be requested
before informing the user
about the types of data
that will be collected and the purpose
for which they will be processed.

## Description

Systems usually request information
from their users or collect it
based on their interactions
with the application.
Regulations demand
that none of these collections
occur without the user's consent,
that this consent be demonstrable afterwards
and that it only be requested
after having informed the user
of the types and purposes
of data collection.
Therefore,
consent must always be requested
in a clear manner
and using easily understandable language
before collecting any personal information.
