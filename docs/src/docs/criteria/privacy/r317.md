## Requirement

The system must allow its users
to request erasure of collected data belonging to them.

## Description

Systems usually request information from their users,
obtain it from third parties
or collect it based on their interactions with the application.
They should have a mechanism that allows users to request the erasure of this
information and guarantees its complete deletion.
Furthermore, the erasure should also occur if the user decides to revoke their
consent.

## Types

- [088. Privacy violation](/types/088)

## Exceptions

1. If the system is able to demonstrate that it is not possible to individually
identify the users based on the information collected from them,
this requirement is not applicable.
