## Requirement

The system must remove sensitive and personal information when it is no longer
required.

## Description

Systems usually request sensitive or personal information from their users or
collect it based on their interactions with the application.
Regulations demand that none of these collections occur without the user's
consent,
and that it not be stored for more time than strictly necessary.
Therefore, the system should delete this information after it is no longer
required.
