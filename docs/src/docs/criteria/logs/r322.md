## Requirement

The system must not register unnecessary information
when logging exceptional events.

## Description

While event logging is generally
a good security practice,
the organization must consider
that using high logging levels
is only appropriate for development environments,
since having too much log information
in production stages
may hinder the performance of a system administrator
in detecting abnormal conditions.
This may imply
that both the attacker
and the attack be able to remain hidden
while trying to penetrate the system,
the audit trail in a forensic analysis
be reduced,
or the debugging of issues
in production environments be hindered.

## Implementation

**1.** Delete big volumes of records
in duplicated logs and replace them
with periodic summary messages.
For example,
**syslog** may register a repetition event saying
"the last message was repeated **X** times",
in order to avoid multiple logging
of the same event.

**2.** Set a maximum size for log files.
If the maximum size is reached,
the system administrator must be notified.
You may also consider reducing subsystem functionalities.
This may cause a denial of service for all users,
but prevent subsystems
from negatively impacting the overall system.

**3.** Properly adjust system settings
when changing from the debugging
to the production stage.

## Attacks

**1.** The system may suffer
in terms of performance
when log files become excessively large
and consume excessive resources.

**2.** By storing too much information in logs,
they lose their value when performing
either a troubleshoot diagnosis
to recover from an attack
or a forensic analysis.

**3.** If administrators are not able
to effectively process files in logs,
attack attempts may remain unnoticed,
which eventually will compromise
the system security.
