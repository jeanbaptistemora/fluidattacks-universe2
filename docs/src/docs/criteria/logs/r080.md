## Requirement

System logs
must not allow modifications
or alterations.

## Description

Logs are used to analyze a systemâ€™s behavior.
They help detect errors and suspicious activity,
and often hold very sensitive information.
Therefore,
they should be protected
so that no unauthorized actor can modify them,
since this could prevent a vulnerability
or a breach from being noticed
in a timely manner.

to access unauthorized functionality

such as access other users' accounts,
view sensitive files,
modify other users' data,
change access rights, etc.
