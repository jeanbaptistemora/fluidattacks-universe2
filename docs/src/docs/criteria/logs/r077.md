## Requirement

The application must not disclose internal system information
such as **stack traces**, *SQL* sentence fragments,
database names or table names.

## Description

Applications should fail safely whenever an unexpected event occurs.
Error message presentation is part of this safe management.
Therefore, specific technical information should not be presented to
unauthorized users,
as this could be leveraged by attackers to further exploit other
vulnerabilities.

## Types

- [037. Technical information leak](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/037/)

- [058. Debugging enabled in production](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/058/)

- [CAPEC-116: Excavation:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html)
An adversary actively probes the target in a manner that is designed to solicit
information that could be leveraged for malicious purposes.
This is achieved by exploring the target via ordinary interactions for the
purpose of gathering intelligence about the target,
or by sending data that is syntactically invalid or non-standard in an attempt
to produce a response that contains the desired data.

An adversary compares output from a target system to known indicators that
uniquely identify specific details about the target.

potentially with a unique ID which support personnel can use to investigate.

are disabled in production to eliminate debug features, developer consoles,
and unintended security disclosures.
