## Requirement

The users that will access the system with administrator or root
privileges must be defined.

## Description

Systems should have a set of roles with different levels
of privilege to access resources.
The privileges of each role must be clearly defined and the role of each user
should also be clearly stated.
That includes the set of users that will have administrator or root privileges,
as this should not be a default role.

An adversary is able to exploit features of the target that should be reserved
for privileged users or administrators but are exposed to use by lower or
non-privileged accounts.
Access to sensitive information and functionality must be controlled to ensure
that only authorized users are able to access these resources.

Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not
properly enforced.
Attackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionality and/or
data, such as access other users' accounts, view sensitive files,
modify other users' data, change access rights, etc.

new features until access is explicitly assigned.
