## Requirement

If the system has an administration mechanism,
it must only be accessible from administrative network segments.

## Description

Network access to modules or system management mechanisms
must be limited to the parties
that require access to them (administrators).
Personnel that does not have administrative needs, tasks or obligations
should not have access to these mechanisms.
Following this recommendation helps to fulfill the objective
of reducing the attack surface of the above mentioned systems
(since malicious third parties cannot attempt
to directly access the system administration settings),
and increases the level of confidentiality and availability of the system.

## Implementation

1. Principle of least privilege:
For each system in the organization
it must be guaranteed that each module
(process, user or program) can only access
the information and resources required
to accomplish its legitimate purpose.

## Attacks

1. An anonymous attacker attempts to access an exposed administrator
interface by brute force,
which may cause a denial of service, account lockouts or an
interface/system lockout.

2. An anonymous attacker and/or registered user
exploits a known vulnerability in the management system,
which may allow access to the system settings,
a denial of service or privileges elevation for system users or processes.

3. An anonymous attacker obtains technical information of the system
through data analysis of the administrator interface
in order to perform deeper and more detailed attacks.

## Attributes

1. Layer: Application layer
2. Asset: System management
3. Scope: Confidentiality
4. Phase: Operation
5. Type of control: Recommendation

The software uses a primary channel for administration or restricted
functionality, but it does not properly protect the channel.

Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not
properly enforced.
Attackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionality and/or
data, such as access other users' accounts, view sensitive files,
modify other users' data, change access rights, etc.
