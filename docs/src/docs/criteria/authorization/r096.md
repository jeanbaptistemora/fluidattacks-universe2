## Requirement

The privileges required by the users
who will access the system must be defined.

## Description

Systems should have a set of roles with different levels
of privilege to access resources.
The privileges of each role must be clearly defined and the role of each user
should also be clearly stated.

## Types

- [031. Excessive privileges](https://docs.fluidattacks.com/types/031)

- [032. Spoofing](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/032/)

- [039. Improper authorization control for web services](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/039/)

- [075. Unauthorized access to files](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/075/)

In the case that the administrator failed to specify an Access Control List
(*ACL*) for a particular element,
an attacker may be able to access it with impunity.
An attacker with the ability to access functionality not properly constrained
by **ACL**s can obtain sensitive information and possibly compromise the entire
application.

An adversary is able to exploit features of the target that should be reserved
for privileged users or administrators but are exposed to use by lower or
non-privileged accounts.
Access to sensitive information and functionality must be controlled to ensure
that only authorized users are able to access these resources.

Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not

Attackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionality and/or
data, such as access other users' accounts, view sensitive files,
modify other users' data, change access rights, etc.
