## Requirement

The system must not allow system actors to modify privileges for themselves.

## Description

Systems should have a set of roles with different levels
of privilege to access resources.
The privileges of each role must be clearly defined and the role of each user
should also be clearly stated.
Furthermore, users should not be allowed to modify their own privileges,
as this could be leveraged to access otherwise restricted functionalities and
resources.

## Types

- [005. Privilege escalation](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/005/)

- [032. Spoofing](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/032/)

An adversary exploits a weakness enabling them to elevate their privilege and

A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform

The software does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for
an actor,
creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

The software does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check
when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining
access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying
the data.

Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not
properly enforced.
Attackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionality and/or
data, such as access other users' accounts, view sensitive files,
modify other users' data, change access rights, etc.

controls cannot be manipulated by end users unless specifically authorized.

Verify that the principle of least privilege exists - users should only be able
to access functions, data files, URLs, controllers, services, and other
resources, for which they possess specific authorization.
This implies protection against spoofing and elevation of privilege.
