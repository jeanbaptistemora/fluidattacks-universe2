In front-end programming,
JavaScript's Console object
provides access to the browser's debugging console[^1].
Arguments passed to `log`, `warn` and `error` methods
are visible to the user that is using the website,
it's also visible to attackers.

As per Fluid Attacks' criteria[^2]
the application must not disclose internal system information
such as stack traces
because this information can be leveraged
to further exploit other vulnerabilities.

Developers tend to do debugging the following way:

```js {3}
try { /* Business logic code goes here ... */ }
catch (err) {
  console.error(err);
}
```

But this ends in lots of information
that attackers use to better understand
the inner workings on the system,
aiding them in creating and improving attack vectors.

```log
Error: <rect> attribute x: Expected length, "NaN".
(anonymous) @ cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/5.16.0/d3.min.js:2
Error: <rect> attribute y: Expected length, "NaN".
(anonymous) @ cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/5.16.0/d3.min.js:2
Error: <rect> attribute transform: Expected number, "rotate(NaN, NaN, NaN)".
...
```
