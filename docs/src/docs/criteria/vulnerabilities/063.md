## Description

The system does not properly check,
on the serverâ€™s side,
whether or not the user has enough permissions
to modify certain fields,
and/or allows them to use
invalid data in some fields.
This is the basis for several types of injections.

## Requirements

- [173. Discard unsafe inputs](/criteria/requirements/173)

- [320. Avoid client-side control enforcement](/criteria/requirements/320)

- [342. Validate request parameters](/criteria/requirements/342)
