## Description

Critical services of the system,
such as databases,
shared resources containing sensitive information
and web services,
are not protected by a multi-factor authentication mechanism.
This makes it easier for an attacker
who has compromised a userâ€™s account
to access those resources.

## Requirements

- [229. Request access credentials](/criteria/requirements/authentication/229)

- [231. Define a biometric verification component](/criteria/requirements/authentication/231)

- [264. Request authentication](/criteria/requirements/authentication/264)

- [319. Make authentication options equally secure](/criteria/requirements/authentication/319)

- [328. Request MFA for critical systems](/criteria/requirements/authentication/328)
