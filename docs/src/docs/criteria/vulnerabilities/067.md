## Description

The system allocates unnecessary resources
due to the use of improper programming practices
or inefficient algorithms.
Alternatively,
the allocation can be controlled by an external source
(e.g., user input), and hence,
requests that consume an enormous amount of resources
are processed without any restriction.

## Requirements

- [072. Set maximum response time](/criteria/requirements/072)

- [158. Define secure programming language](/criteria/requirements/158)

- [164. Use optimized structures](/criteria/requirements/164)

- [173. Discard unsafe inputs](/criteria/requirements/173)
