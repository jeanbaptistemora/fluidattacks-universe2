## Description

The system uses one or more entities,
such as a proxy or a firewall,
to process requests
between the client and the server.
These entities do not process
HTTP requests consistently,
thus making it possible to post malformed requests
to get one of the entities to process a request
without the other ones noticing it.
The reason the entities do not process the requests consistently
is that the web server software
each one uses delimits requests differently.
