## Description

The system uses insecure functions,
insufficient ranges or low-entropy components
to generate random numbers.
This could allow an attacker
to guess the generation sequence
after a short time or predict results
using probabilistic methods.

## Requirements

- [223. Uniform distribution in random numbers](/criteria/requirements/cryptography/223)

- [224. Use secure cryptographic mechanisms](/criteria/requirements/cryptography/224)
