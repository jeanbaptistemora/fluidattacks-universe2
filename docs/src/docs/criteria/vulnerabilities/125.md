## Description

The system displays
the application's directories,
allowing an attacker
to know the content of
the files stored on the server.

## Recommendation

- Disable the configurations
  of the server that allow
  to execute directory listing.

- Establish index files
  that will be shown
  when the directories are loaded.

## Requirements

- [176. Restrict system objects](/criteria/requirements/176)

- [266. Disable insecure functionalities](/criteria/requirements/266)
