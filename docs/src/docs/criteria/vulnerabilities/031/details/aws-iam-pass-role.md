To configure many AWS services,
you must pass an IAM role to the service.
This allows the service to later assume the role
and perform actions on your behalf.

By giving a role or user the `iam:PassRole` permission,
you are saying:
> this principal is allowed to assign AWS roles to resources
and services in this account.

You can limit which roles a user or service
can pass to others by specifying the role ARN(s)
in the Resource field of the policy
that grants them `iam:PassRole`:

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "iam:PassRole",
  "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:::123456789012:role/SomeRole"
    "arn:aws:::123456789012:role/OtherRole"
  ]
}
```

As a rule of thumb,
you should include **only** the roles
required by your application.
Wildcards and over-permissive resource grants
highly increase the probability of (or completely allow)
a privilege escalation.
