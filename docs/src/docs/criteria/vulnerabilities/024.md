## Description

The system's network configuration
does not properly limit access
between network segments.
This allows employees from any office
to access administrative services
of servers and other offices.
Alternatively,
servers that are supposed to be accessed
only from an internal network
are exposed to other network segments,
such as the internet.

## Requirements

- [255. Allow access only to the necessary ports](/criteria/requirements/255)
