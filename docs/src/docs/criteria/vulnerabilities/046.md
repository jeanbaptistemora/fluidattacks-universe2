## Description

It is possible to obtain source code of the application
because it has not been obfuscated
using a secure mechanism.
This could allow an attacker
to understand the inner workings
of the application
or get technical
or sensitive information.

## Requirements

- [159. Obfuscate code](/criteria/requirements/159)
