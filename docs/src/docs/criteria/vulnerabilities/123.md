## Description

The application allows to read
or execute files
located on the server
through relative paths manipulation
in the input fields.

## Requirements

- [173. Discard unsafe inputs](/criteria/requirements/173)

- [176. Restrict system objects](/criteria/requirements/176)

## Recommendation

- Validate that the parameters received
  by the application do not contain
  relative paths.

- Disable insecure functions
  that allow reading of arbitrary files
  on the server.
