## Description

The source code uses generic exceptions
to handle unexpected errors.
Catching generic exceptions
obscures the problem that caused the error
and promotes a generic way
to handle different categories
or sources of error.
This may cause
security vulnerabilities to materialize,
as some special flows go unnoticed.

Using a "**catch**" statement
to catch a high-level class
such as "**Exception**"
can hide exceptions that deserve special treatment
or that should not be handled
at that point in the program.
It negates the purpose of typified exceptions
(e.g., "**ValueError**", "**ConnectionError**" and "**NullPointerException**"),
and it can be particularly dangerous
if the program grows
and starts throwing new types of exceptions,
as the new types will not receive any attention
when caught by the "**catch**" statement.
