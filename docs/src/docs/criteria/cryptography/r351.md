## Requirement

Each individual device must have unique cryptographic keys
and certificates.

- [CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/326.html)
The software stores or transmits sensitive data using an encryption scheme
that is theoretically sound,
but is not strong enough for the level of protection required.

- [CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/330.html)
The software uses insufficiently random numbers
or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

Verify that cryptographic keys
and certificates are unique to each individual device.

Verify that the challenge nonce is at least 64 bits in length,
and statistically unique
or unique over the lifetime of the cryptographic device.

Verify that nonces, initialization vectors,
and other single use numbers must not be used
more than once with a given encryption key.
The method of generation must be appropriate for the algorithm being used.
