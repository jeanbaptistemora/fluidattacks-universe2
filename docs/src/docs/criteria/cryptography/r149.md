## Requirement

The symmetric encryption mechanism must use a minimum key size of **128 bits**.

## Findings

- [CAPEC-20: Encryption Brute Forcing:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)
An attacker, armed with the cipher text and the encryption algorithm used,
performs an exhaustive (brute force) search on the key space
to determine the key that decrypts the cipher text to obtain the plaintext.
