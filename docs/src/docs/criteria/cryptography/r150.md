## Requirement

Use hash functions with a minimum size of **256 bits**.

## Findings

## References

- [CAPEC-20: Encryption Brute Forcing:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)
An attacker, armed with the cipher text and the encryption algorithm used,
performs an exhaustive (brute force) search on the key space
to determine the key that decrypts the cipher text to obtain the plaintext.

Verify that there is an explicit policy for management of cryptographic keys
and that a cryptographic key lifecycle follows a key management standard
such as **NIST SP 800-57**.
