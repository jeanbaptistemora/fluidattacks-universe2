## Requirement

Use hash functions with a minimum size of **256 bits**.

## Types

- [051. Cracked weak credentials](/types/051)

- [052. Insecure encryption algorithm](/types/052)

## References

- [CAPEC-20: Encryption Brute Forcing:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)
An attacker, armed with the cipher text
and the encryption algorithm used,
performs an exhaustive (brute force) search
on the key space
to determine the key
that decrypts the cipher text
to obtain the plaintext.

Verify that there is an explicit policy
for management of cryptographic keys
and that a cryptographic key lifecycle follows
a key management standard
such as **NIST SP 800-57**.
