title: Disable insecure TLS versions
sidebar_label: Disable insecure TLS versions

## Requirement

The system must disable out-of-date
or insecure versions of **SSL** and **TLS** protocols, algorithms and ciphers.

## Descriptions

All communications between the client and the server
should take place over channels that are protected and encrypted.
In order to guarantee this, out-of-date or insecure protocols
such as **SSLv2**, **SSLv3**, or **TLS** 1.0 and **TLS** 1.1
should be disabled. The latest version of TLS should be used
and communications should not be allowed to fall back on insecure
or unencrypted protocols.

## References

- [CAPEC-94: Man in the Middle Attack:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html)
This type of attack targets the communication between two components
(typically client and server).
The attacker places themself in the communication channel
between the two components.
Whenever one component attempts to communicate with the other
(data flow, authentication challenges, etc.),
the data first goes to the attacker,
who has the opportunity to observe or alter it,
and it is then passed on to the other component as if it was never observed.

- [CAPEC-117: Interception:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/117.html)
An adversary monitors data streams to
or from the target for information gathering purposes.
This attack may be undertaken to solely gather sensitive information
or to support a further attack against the target.
This attack pattern can involve sniffing network traffic
as well as other types of data streams (e.g., radio).

- [CAPEC-212: Functionality Misuse:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/212.html)
An adversary leverages a legitimate capability of an application
in such a way as to achieve a negative technical impact.
The system functionality is not altered or modified
but used in a way that was not intended.

- [CAPEC-216: Communication Channel Manipulation:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/216.html)
An adversary manipulates a setting or parameter on communications channel
in order to compromise its security.
This can result in information exposure, insertion/removal of information
from the communications stream, and/or potentially system compromise.

- [CAPEC-272: Protocol Manipulation:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/272.html)
An adversary subverts a communications protocol to perform an attack.
This type of attack targets invalid assumptions
that may be inherent in implementers of the protocol,
incorrect implementations of the protocol,
or vulnerabilities in the protocol itself.

- [CAPEC-594: Traffic Injection:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/594.html)
An adversary injects traffic into the target’s network connection.
The adversary is therefore able to degrade or disrupt the connection,
and potentially modify the content.

- [CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html)
The software transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext
in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

- [CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/326.html)
The software stores or transmits sensitive data using an encryption scheme
that is theoretically sound,
but is not strong enough for the level of protection required.

- [Algorithm Downgrade:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/757.html)
A protocol or its implementation supports interaction between multiple actors
and allows those actors to negotiate which algorithm should be used
as a protection mechanism such as encryption or authentication,
but it does not select the strongest algorithm
that is available to both parties.

Many web applications and **APIs** do not properly protect sensitive data,
such as financial, healthcare, and **PII**.
Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data
to conduct credit card fraud, identity theft, or other crimes.
Sensitive data may be compromised without extra protection,
such as encryption at rest or in transit,
and requires special precautions when exchanged with the browser.

Verify that the device cannot be downgraded to old versions
(anti-rollback) of valid firmware.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V9.1 Communications Security Requirements.(9.1.1):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify that secured TLS is used for all client connectivity,
and does not fall back to insecure or unencrypted protocols.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V9.1 Communications Security Requirements.(9.1.2):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify using online or up to date **TLS** testing tools
that only strong algorithms, ciphers, and protocols are enabled,
with the strongest algorithms and ciphers set as preferred.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V9.1 Communications Security Requirements.(9.1.3):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify that old versions of **SSL** and **TLS** protocols, algorithms, ciphers,
and configuration are disabled, such as **SSLv2**, **SSLv3**, or **TLS** 1.0
and **TLS** 1.1. The latest version of **TLS**
should be the preferred cipher suite.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V9.2 Server Communications Security Requirements.(9.2.2):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
Verify that encrypted communications such as **TLS** is used for all inbound
and outbound connections, including for management ports, monitoring,
authentication, **API**, or web service calls, database, cloud, serverless,
mainframe, external, and partner connections.
The server must not fall back to insecure or unencrypted protocols.

Where **POS POI** terminals use **SSL** and/or early **TLS**,
the entity must confirm the devices are not susceptible to any known exploits
for those protocols.
