## Requirement

The system's private asymmetric or symmetric keys must be protected
and should not be exposed.

## Description

The system's cryptographic keys are essential for maintaining the confidentiality
and integrity of transactions and communications.
Their exposure may cause business information leakages, loss of data integrity
and loss of trust due to the inability to differentiate server traffic from
malicious traffic.
Therefore, these keys must be protected and managed following industry-verified
standards.

## Types

- [009. Sensitive information in source code](https://docs.fluidattacks.com/types/009/)

- [CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/321.html)
The use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the
possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.

- [CWE-322: Key Exchange without Entity Authentication:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/322.html)
The software performs a key exchange with an actor without verifying the
identity of that actor.

Nonces should be used for the present occasion and only once.

- [CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/522.html)
The product transmits or stores authentication credentials,
but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception
and/or retrieval.

Many web applications and **API**s do not properly protect sensitive data,
such as financial, healthcare, and *PII*.
Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit card
fraud, identity theft, or other crimes.
Sensitive data may be compromised without extra protection,
such as encryption at rest or in transit, and requires special precautions when
exchanged with the browser.

in a Secure Element, *TPM*, *TEE* (Trusted Execution Environment),
or protected using strong cryptography.

protected,
such as by using a hardware security module or secure operating system based
key storage.

and protected against disclosure,
such as using a *TPM* or *HSM*, or an *OS* service that can use this secure
storage.
