## Requirement

Critical communications should travel
through a secure channel
that implements **perfect forward secrecy**.

## Descriptions

All communications between the client
and the server should take place over channels
that are protected and encrypted.
Secure channels often use a single secret
to encrypt all communications.
Therefore,
if that secret is breached,
all past communications
can be decrypted and compromised.
**Perfect forward secrecy** is attained
when each message in a conversation
is encrypted using a different secret.
Thus,
if a secret is breached,
only a small portion of a conversation
can be compromised,
which represents an increase
in the overall security
of the system.

- [CAPEC-117: Interception:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/117.html)
An adversary monitors data streams to
or from the target
for information gathering purposes.
This attack may be undertaken
to solely gather sensitive information
or to support a further attack
against the target.
This attack pattern
can involve sniffing network traffic
as well as other types
of data streams (e.g., radio).

The software stores
or transmits sensitive data using
an encryption scheme
that is theoretically sound,
but is not strong enough
for the level of protection required.

Prefer ephemeral keys over static keys
(i.e., prefer DHE over DH, and prefer ECDHE 690 over ECDH).
Ephemeral keys provide **perfect forward secrecy**.

Many web applications and **APIs**
do not properly protect sensitive data,
such as financial,
healthcare and **PII**.
Attackers may steal
or modify such weakly protected data
to conduct credit card fraud,
identity theft or other crimes.
Sensitive data may be compromised
without extra protection,
such as encryption at rest or in transit,
and requires special precautions
when exchanged with the browser.
