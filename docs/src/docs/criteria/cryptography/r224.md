## Requirement

The system must use the most secure cryptographic mechanism
provided by the platform (e.g., **java.security.SecureRandom**)
for random number generation used in critical processes
(e.g., ID generation, code mapping, cryptographic keys).

## Descriptions

The system’s cryptographic keys are essential for maintaining
the confidentiality and integrity of transactions and communications.
Some of these keys and other critical elements
are generated using random numbers.
In these cases, the random numbers themselves must be generated
using secure mechanisms,
which have often already been implemented by the platform.

## Types

- [034. Insecure generation of random numbers](/types/034)

- [078. Insecurely generated token](/types/078)

- [CAPEC-20: Encryption Brute Forcing:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)
An attacker, armed with the cipher text and the encryption algorithm used,
performs an exhaustive (brute force) search on the key space to determine
the key that decrypts the cipher text to obtain the plaintext.

- [CAPEC-94: Man in the Middle Attack:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html)
This type of attack targets the communication between two components
(typically client and server).
The attacker places themself in the communication channel
between the two components.
Whenever one component attempts to communicate with the other
(data flow, authentication challenges, etc.),
the data first goes to the attacker,
who has the opportunity to observe or alter it,
and it is then passed on to the other component as if it was never observed.

- [CAPEC-117: Interception:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/117.html)
An adversary monitors data streams to
or from the target for information gathering purposes.
This attack may be undertaken to solely gather sensitive information
or to support a further attack against the target.
This attack pattern can involve sniffing network traffic
as well as other types of data streams (e.g., radio).

- [CAPEC-151: Identity Spoofing:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/151.html)
Identity Spoofing refers to the action of assuming (i.e., taking on)
the identity of some other entity (human or non-human)
and then using that identity to accomplish a goal.
An adversary may craft messages that appear to come from a different principle
or use stolen / spoofed authentication credentials.
Alternatively, an adversary may intercept a message from a legitimate sender
and attempt to make it look like the message comes from them
without changing its content.

- [CAPEC-216: Communication Channel Manipulation:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/216.html)
An adversary manipulates a setting or parameter on communications channel
in order to compromise its security. This can result in information exposure,
insertion/removal of information from the communications stream,
and/or potentially system compromise.

- [CAPEC-272: Protocol Manipulation:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/272.html)
An adversary subverts a communications protocol to perform an attack.
This type of attack targets invalid assumptions
that may be inherent in implementers of the protocol,
incorrect implementations of the protocol,
or vulnerabilities in the protocol itself.

- [CAPEC-594: Traffic Injection:](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/594.html)
An adversary injects traffic into the target’s network connection.
The adversary is therefore able to degrade or disrupt the connection,
and potentially modify the content.

- [CWE-333: Improper Handling of Insufficient Entropy in TRNG:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/333.html)
True random number generators (TRNG) generally have a limited source of entropy
