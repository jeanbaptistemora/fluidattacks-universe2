The product prepares
to release a resource
such as memory
or a file so that the resource
can be reused by other entities,
but the product does not fully clear
previously-used sensitive information
from that resource
before the resource is released.

or supporting resources
after they have been used.

maintained in memory is overwritten

it is no longer required.

for management of cryptographic keys
and that a cryptographic key lifecycle follows
a key management standard
