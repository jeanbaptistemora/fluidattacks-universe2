- [CWE-226: Sensitive Information Uncleared in Resource Before Release for Reuse:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/226.html)
The product prepares to release a resource such as memory or a file so that the
resource can be reused by other entities,
but the product does not fully clear previously-used sensitive information from
that resource before the resource is released.

The software does not properly "clean up" and remove temporary or supporting
resources after they have been used.

and that a cryptographic key lifecycle follows a key management standard such
as **NIST SP 800-57**.

using zeros or random data.
