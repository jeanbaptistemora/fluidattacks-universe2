## Requirement

The system's cryptographic functions must be implemented
with pre-existing and up-to-date cryptographic mechanisms.

## Description

The system's cryptographic functions are essential for maintaining the
confidentiality and integrity of transactions and communications.
Therefore, these functions must be based
on pre-existent, tested, approved and secure mechanisms.

An attacker, armed with the cipher text and the encryption algorithm used,
performs an exhaustive (brute force) search on the key space to determine the
key that decrypts the cipher text to obtain the plaintext.
