## Requirement

The system's cryptographic functions
must be implemented with pre-existing
and up-to-date cryptographic mechanisms.

## Description

The system's cryptographic functions
are essential for maintaining
the confidentiality and integrity
of transactions and communications.
Therefore,
these functions must be based
on pre-existent, tested, approved
and secure mechanisms.

An attacker,
armed with the cipher text
and the encryption algorithm used,
performs an exhaustive (brute force) search
on the key space
to determine the key
that decrypts the cipher text
to obtain the plaintext.
