## Requirement

One-time passwords (*OTP*) must have a maximum lifespan of *60* seconds.

## Description

*OTP*s are tokens that help hinder phishing (impersonation) attacks.
They should be generated using secure cryptographic algorithms,
be sent over a protected channel and have a short lifespan that considers
network delay and entry time.
Furthermore, it should only be possible to use them once within their validity
period.

When an actor claims to have a given identity,
the software does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

The software stores or transmits sensitive data using an encryption scheme that
is theoretically sound,
but is not strong enough for the level of protection required.

Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits
an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization.

Time-based OTPs SHALL have a defined lifetime that is determined by the
expected clock drift — in either direction — of the authenticator over its
lifetime.

channel when collecting the OTP in order to provide resistance to eavesdropping
and MitM attacks.

verifiers SHALL accept a given time-based OTP only once during the validity
period.

Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users' identities
temporarily or permanently.
