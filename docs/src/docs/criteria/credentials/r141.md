## Requirement

The system must force users to re-authenticate
or invalidate their session
if the state of their account changes
(e.g., password change/recovery,
lockouts, user deletion, etc.).

## Types

- [076. Insecure session management](/types/076)

Insufficient Session Expiration
is when a web site permits an attacker
to reuse old session credentials
or session IDs for authorization.

Application functions related to authentication
and session management
are often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords,
keys, or session tokens.
