## Requirement

The system must store passwords
with different key derivations (*Salt*).

## Findings

Encrypt or hash with a salt all authentication credentials when stored.

- [CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/759.html)
The software uses a one-way cryptographic hash against an input that should not
be reversible, such as a password,
but the software does not also use a salt as part of the input.

- [CWE-760: Use of a One-Way Hash with a Predictable Salt:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/760.html)
The software uses a one-way cryptographic hash against an input that should not
be reversible, such as a password,
but the software uses a predictable salt as part of the input.

- [CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort:](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/916.html)
The software generates a hash for a password,
but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational
effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

Memorized secrets SHALL be salted and hashed using a suitable one-way key
derivation function.

- [OWASP-ASVS v4.0.1 V2.4 Credential Storage Requirements.(2.4.1):](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/) 
Verify that passwords are stored in a form that is resistant to offline
attacks.
Passwords SHALL be salted and hashed using an approved one-way key derivation
or password hashing function.
Key derivation and password hashing functions take a password, a salt,
and a cost factor as inputs when generating a password hash.
