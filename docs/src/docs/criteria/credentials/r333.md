## Requirement

The salt values used during the password hashing process
must be stored separately from the hashed passwords.

## Description

Adding random salt to a password
as part of the hashing process drastically
increases the time required
to crack that password.
Salt values should be stored
in a system different from the one
in which hashed passwords are stored
so that if the hashes are breached,
an attacker still has to test
every possible salt value
in order to crack a single password.

for a password,
but it uses a scheme
that does not provide a sufficient level
of computational effort
that would make password cracking attacks
infeasible or expensive.

that is at least as strong
as the data-encrypting key,

from the data-encrypting key.
