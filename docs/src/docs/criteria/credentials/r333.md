## Requirement

The salt values used during the password hashing process must be stored
separately from the hashed passwords.

## Description

Adding random salt to a password as part of the hashing process
drastically increases the time required to crack that password.
Salt values should be stored in a system different from the one in which
hashed passwords are stored so that if the hashes are breached,
an attacker still has to test every possible salt value in order to crack
a single password.

The software generates a hash for a password,
but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational
effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

key, and that is stored separately from the data-encrypting key.
