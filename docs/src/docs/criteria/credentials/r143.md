accounts will use passwords
that are unique to that system.

Application functions related to authentication
and session management
are often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords,
keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws
to assume other users' identities
temporarily or permanently.
