## Requirement

One-time passwords must be at least 6 characters long.

## Description

One-time passwords (*OTP*) are secrets used during operations that need added
security or as part of user enrollment processes.
Despite their short lifespan, they should have a minimum length of 6 characters
as a protection against brute force attacks.

## Types

- [035. Weak credential policy](/types/035)

- [050. Guessed weak credentials](/types/050)

Memorized secrets that are randomly chosen by the CSP (e.g., at enrollment)

SHALL be at least 6 characters in length

Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users' identities
temporarily or permanently.
