## Requirement

The system must require passphrases to be at least 4 words long
and allow them to have 64 characters or more.

## Description

Passwords are identity assertion elements that can be easily forgotten.
Passphrases are sequences of words that are longer than passwords
but are also easier to remember.
Thus, systems should enforce the use of passphrases at least 4 words long
and allow them to have 64 characters or more.

## Types

* [050. Guessed weak credentials](https://fluidattacks.com/products/rules/findings/050/)

- [CAPEC-49: Password Brute Forcing:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/49.html)
In this attack, the adversary tries every possible value for a password until
they succeed.
A brute force attack, if feasible computationally, will always be successful
because it will essentially go through all possible passwords given the
alphabet used (lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, symbols, etc.)
and the maximum length of the password.

- [CAPEC-560: Use of Known Domain Credentials:](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/560.html)
An adversary guesses or obtains (i.e., steals or purchases) legitimate
credentials (e.g., userID/password) to achieve authentication and to perform
authorized actions under the guise of an authenticated user or service.

The product does not require that users should have strong passwords,
which makes it easier for attackers to compromise user accounts.

For password-only authentication for interactive user access,
either technically or procedurally enforce the following password parameters:
Password length that is, at least,  the lesser of eight characters or the
maximum length supported by the Cyber Asset;
and minimum password complexity that is the lesser of three or more different
types of characters
(e.g., uppercase alphabetic, lowercase alphabetic, numeric, non-alphanumeric)
or the maximum complexity supported by the Cyber Asset.

characters in length.

characters or equivalent complexity and strength.
