We recognize that sometimes you need
guidance on ARM operations or one of
our services.
That is why we have the **Talk to Hacker**
option on our platform (only available on
[Squad Plan](/squad/support/talk-hacker)).
This function allows you to schedule a
videoconference where you can present the
matters on which you need help.
In this way, we facilitate our communication
and can respond to you as quickly as possible.

1. To find this option,
  you need to enter one of your
  groups on the ARM and click on
  the question mark icon on the
  top-right corner of the screen.

1. A pop-up window will appear
  where you will find
  **Talk to Hacker** next to
  our other support options.

  videoconference according to your
  convenience to meet your information needs.

  to make the appointment.
  In addition, you can add guests: people
  from your team that you want to
  join the call.
  Then, you click on the blue
  **Schedule event** button.

1. After that, you can see the
  pop-up window that gives you the
  information about the appointment,
  including the name of the expert
  you will talk to.

1. Finally, you receive an email with
  an invitation to the appointment,
  which is included in your Google Calendar.

Our priority is to serve your
communication requests in the
best possible way.
We hope this option will be
of great benefit to you.
