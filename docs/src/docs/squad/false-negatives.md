In the course
of the penetration testing
done by our hackers
with the Squad plan,
there may come occasions
where you notice
an open vulnerability
that wasn't reported
by our hackers,
this would be
a **False negative**.
When this happens,
in order to handle
this incident
with the utmost care,
we will follow with you
the following protocol.

## Protocol

1. The client reports the incident
  over any of the available
  communication channels,
1. The Project Manager
  suspends the billing
  and any pending charges
  with the administrative area,
1. Fluid Attacks appoints
  a 2-hour meeting
  with the client
  in less than 8 office hours,
    - The Account Manager
      and an Ethical Hacker
      will attend the meeting,
    - We will proceed to analize
      and understand
      the client's report,
    - Also,
      try to replicate the issue
      in the environments
      (if possible),
1. Fluid Attacks schedules
  a weekly meeting
  about the postmortem status,
    - Taking place from 11:55AM
      to 12:05PM (10 minutes),
    - The first meeting is
      7 days later
      with no end date
      (recurring),
    - From the client's side
      at least the reporter of the incident
      and their two inmediate superiors
      will attend the meetings,
    - From Fluid Attacks' side
      at least the Account Manager
      and their two inmediate superiors
      will attend the meetings,
    - The meeting is lead
      by Fluid Attacks' Account Manager,
    - The agenda for the day would be
      pending postmortem of both parties
      and report dates,
1. Fluid Attacks gives the client
  the [potential leak form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p2q6xR0D8x8RgQAZRVgHTSU9-AxgMOqxVkyO6aBbk1M).
1. The client fills
  the potential leak form.
