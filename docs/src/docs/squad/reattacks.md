When you have applied a solution
for an existing vulnerability,
you can request a reattack
for us to validate this.
In order to do this,
log into your ASM account
and click on one of your groups to access it,
when you are inside the group,
you will be greeted
by a list of all the types of vulnerabilities
that the group has.

![Group Vulnerabilities Tab](/img/web/vulnerabilities/management/vuln_tab_reattacks.png)

Now look for the type of vulnerability
that contains the individual vulnerability
or vulnerabilities
that you want to request a reattack for
and click on it.
By doing this you will land on
the **Locations** tab of the type of vulnerability
that you chose
and here you will find the **Reattack** button,
but only if the chosen vulnerability is **Open**,
in case it is **Closed**,
the button will not appear.

![Enabled Reattacks Button](/img/web/vulnerabilities/management/reattack_button_enabled.png)

When you click on it,
the button will deactivate
until you select the vulnerabilities
you want to reattack

![Disabled Reattack Button](/img/web/vulnerabilities/management/reattack_button_disabled.png)

After selecting one or more vulnerabilities
you can click on the Reattack button again,
or you can click on Cancel
to dismiss the process.

The following form will appear,
you can explain the solution applied
and click on Proceed
to finish the request
or Cancel to dismiss it.

When you finish requesting the reattack,
our analysts will verify
that the vulnerability was indeed solved
and close or keep it open
depending on the verification result.
