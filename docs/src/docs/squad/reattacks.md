When you have applied a solution for an existing vulnerability,
you can request a reattack
for us to validate its effectiveness.
In order to do this,
follow these steps:

1. Log into your ASM account
  and click on one of your groups to access it.
  Once inside the group,
  you will see a list of all the types of vulnerabilities it has.

1. Now look for the type of vulnerability
  that contains the individual vulnerability
  or vulnerabilities
  for which you want to request a reattack
  and click on it.
  By doing this,
  you will land on the **Locations** tab
  of the type of vulnerability you chose.
  You will see the **Reattack** button on the right-hand side of the screen,
  but only if the chosen vulnerability is open;
  in case it is closed,
  the button will not appear.

1. Click on the button.
  It will deactivate until you select the vulnerabilities you want to reattack.

1. After selecting one or more vulnerabilities,
  you can click on the **Reattack** button again
  or click on **Cancel** to dismiss the process.

1. The following form will appear
  where you will have to explain the applied solution.

1. You may then click on **Proceed** to finish the request
  or **Cancel** to dismiss it.

When you finish requesting the reattack,
our analysts will verify
that the vulnerability was indeed solved
and close it or keep it open depending on the result.
