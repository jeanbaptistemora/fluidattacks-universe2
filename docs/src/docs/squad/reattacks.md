When you have applied a solution for an existing vulnerability,
you can request a reattack
for us to validate its effectiveness.
In order to do this,
follow these steps:

1. Log into your ASM account
  and click on one of your groups to access it.
  Once inside the group,
  you will see a list of all the types of vulnerabilities it has.

   ![Group Vulnerabilities Tab](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1622211885/docs/web/vulnerabilities/management/vuln_tab_reattacks_dwmdrz.webp)

1. Now look for the type of vulnerability
  that contains the individual vulnerability
  or vulnerabilities
  for which you want to request a reattack
  and click on it.
  By doing this,
  you will land on the **Locations** tab
  of the type of vulnerability you chose.
  You will see the **Reattack** button on the right-hand side of the screen,
  but only if the chosen vulnerability is open;
  in case it is closed,
  the button will not appear.

   ![Enabled Reattacks Button](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1622211885/docs/web/vulnerabilities/management/reattack_button_enabled_h4orlp.webp)

1. Click on the button.
  It will deactivate until you select the vulnerabilities you want to reattack.

   ![Disabled Reattack Button](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1622211885/docs/web/vulnerabilities/management/reattack_button_disabled_erqpi4.webp)

1. After selecting one or more vulnerabilities,
  you can click on the **Reattack** button again
  or click on **Cancel** to dismiss the process.

1. The following form will appear
  where you will have to explain the applied solution.

   ![Reattack Request Form](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1622211883/docs/web/vulnerabilities/management/reattack_form_eigvze.webp)

1. You may then click on **Proceed** to finish the request
  or **Cancel** to dismiss it.

1. After requesting the reattack,
  you will see the word **Requested**
  in the **Reattack** column corresponding
  to that vulnerability.
  From then on,
  you will have to wait for the
  response from the `Fluid Attacks` team.
  The latterâ€™s response time will
  comply with the conditions set forth in the service-level agreements.

   ![Reattack Requested](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1647974014/docs/squad/reattack/requested_tab.png)

1. In the **Consulting** tab,
  you will see a new comment related
  to the justification you gave when
  requesting the reattack.
  In this same tab,
  our hackers can generate other
  comments and notify the decision
  taken on your request.

   ![Consulting Tab](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1647974014/docs/squad/reattack/consulting_tab.png)

1. If the vulnerability you
  requested to reattack is
  still open,
  in the **Evidence** tab,
  our hackers will give you
  evidence of how it was exploited.
  The reattack status will
  be Verified (open).

   ![Evidence Tab](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1647974014/docs/squad/reattack/evidence_tab.png)

1. The two possible reattack statuses,
  after they have been carried out,
  are **Verified (open)** and
  **Verified (closed)**.
  In the parenthesis,
  the status of the reattacked
  vulnerability is reiterated.

   ![Verified Open](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1647974013/docs/squad/reattack/reattack_status_verified_open.png)

   ![Verified Closed](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1647974013/docs/squad/reattack/reattack_status_verified_closed.png)

1. If the vulnerability is still
  open and you cannot close
  it for the moment,
  you can consider defining other
  [treatments](/machine/web/vulnerabilities/management/treatments).
  One of them is
  **Permanently accepted vulnerability**.
  However,
  you can later try to remediate
  this vulnerability and
  [request a reattack](/machine/web/vulnerabilities/management/treatments/#reattacking-a-permanently-accepted-vulnerability)
  to verify its remediation.

When you finish requesting the reattack,
our analysts will verify
that the vulnerability was indeed solved
and close it or keep it open depending on the result.

## Reattacks on hold

Sometimes reattacks are delayed
due to [events](/machine/web/groups/events)
in your environment,
and having to send another
reattack request can be tedious.
That is why the ASM has the
**On_hold** status for reattacks.
This status denotes when
reattack requests are put on hold.
When the events are solved,
the reattack request is
automatically reactivated
without having to be repeated.
This use of automation provides
agility to the reattack process.
