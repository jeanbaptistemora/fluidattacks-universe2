At `Fluid Attacks`,
we are continuously building not only cybersecurity software
but also a variety of written content.
Apart from our main website,
where we display information related to our services and solutions,
and where we have an ongoing publication of cybersecurity blog posts,
in 2021 we launched this Documentation site.

Here, we aim to compile coherent and clear texts
both for people inside and outside our team.
We want to have sufficiently precise material
to answer a large number of questions that arise in our day-to-day work
and also to standardize processes and facilitate learning.
It is exactly for this reason, along with conciseness and clarity,
that we sought to propose a set of guidelines
that would allow us to homogenize our writing and publishing activities.

These guidelines are divided as follows:
In the first part, we offer general writing tips
among which there are some oriented, for example,
towards the handling of capital letters, italics and numbers.
In the second part, we focus on guidelines
that apply only to written material within our Documentation.
This part is followed by another one
oriented only to shaping our blog posts.
Finally, we have some rules
strictly related to the use of Semantic Line Breaks (SLBs).

> **NOTE:**
> This section of the Documentation is currently under construction.
