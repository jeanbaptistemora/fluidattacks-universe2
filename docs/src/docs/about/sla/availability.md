## Description

**99%** of the time
the ASM will be available via internet
for its registered users.

### Details

Besides the
[general measurement aspects](/about/sla#details),
this SLA is measured
taking into account
the following:

1. The reference schedule
  for the availability
  is 24 hours a day,
  7 days a week.
1. For partial availability failures
  (only for one functionality),
  the measurement will be based on
  the affected office hours
  and will be adjusted
  according to the percentage
  of affected users.
