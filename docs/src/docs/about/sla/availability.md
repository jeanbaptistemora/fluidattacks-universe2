### Description

**99%** of the time
the ASM will be available via internet
for its registered users.

### Details

Besides the
[general measurement aspects](/about/sla#details),
this SLA is measured
taking into account
the following:

1. Office hours correspond
  to eight-hour bussiness days,
  like this:
  8AM-12M and 1PM-5PM.
1. For partial availability failures
  (only for one functionality),
  the measurement will be based on
  the affected office hours
  and will be adjusted
  according to the percentage
  of affected users.
