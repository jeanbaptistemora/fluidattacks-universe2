### ToE

The Target of Evaluation or ToE is the product or system that will be the subject
of the penetration testing done by Fluidattacks. The ToE is mostly defined by specifying
which git repositories and/or environments you want us to check by adding Git Roots
and its environments in the Scope section of a group.

### CVSS

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System or CVSS is a free and open industry standard
for assessing the severity of computer system security vulnerabilities. CVSS attempts
to assign severity scores to vulnerabilities, allowing responders to prioritize responses
and resources according to threat. Scores are calculated based on a formula that
depends on several metrics that approximate ease of exploit and the impact of exploit.
Scores range from 0 to 10, with 10 being the most severe.
