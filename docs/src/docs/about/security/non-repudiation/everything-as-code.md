At `Fluid Attacks`,
we try to keep as much material as possible
versioned in a Git repository.
By doing so,
we can have comprehensive logs of exactly

- what was changed;

- who changed it;

- when it was changed, and

- who approved the change.

Currently,
we keep all our systems as code:

- [Attack Surface Manager (ASM)](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/product/-/commits/master)

- [Continuous Hacking](https://fluidattacks.com/services/continuous-hacking/)

- [Infrastructure](https://fluidattacks.com/about/security/#IAC)

- General documentation
