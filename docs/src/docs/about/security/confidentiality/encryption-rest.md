All our applications and services
have industry-standard
[encryption at rest](/criteria/cryptography/224).

- All the sensitive data
provided by our clients
(repository access keys, VPN credentials, etc.)
is encrypted using the symmetric algorithm
of our key management system (KMS).
This algorithm is based on
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
in Galois Counter Mode (GCM) with
[256-bit](/criteria/cryptography/150)
[private keys](/criteria/cryptography/145).
AES256 is the
[US government standard](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.197.pdf)
encryption algorithm used to protect top-secret information.
Additionally,
client data is also protected using
[HMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC)
with [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) hashes.

- All our domain names are protected with
[DNSSEC](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/dnssec-what-is-it-why-important-2019-03-05-en)
to ensure that DNS records
received by clients are identical
to the DNS records published by us.

- All our clients' code repositories
are stored in private,
[AES256 ciphered](/criteria/data/185)
redundant data centers.

- Our exploits are stored encrypted
using AES256 keys.

- All [Attack Surface Manager (ASM)](https://app.fluidattacks.com/)
data is stored
in an AES256 encrypted database.

- Most of our encrypted-at-rest secrets
are only decrypted in memory,
meaning that they are never stored
on a hard drive when decrypted.
This highly reduces the possibility
of data leakage caused
by leaving unprotected files
with decrypted secrets
stored on hard drives.

- All our products use our KMS
for both development and production secrets.

- All our Windows laptops
have their hard drives encrypted
using Bitlocker.
A domain controller continuously checks
adherence to this policy.

- All our Linux laptops
have their hard drives encrypted
from bootloader using LUKS.
