All our applications
and services have industry-standard
[encryption in transit](/criteria/requirements/224).

- The [Fluid Attacks](https://fluidattacks.com/)
  domain uses the latest
  [TLSv1.3](/criteria/requirements/181)
  cryptographic protocol
  for maximum in transit protection.

- We maintain an SSL A+ score from
  [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=fluidattacks.com&latest).

- Digital certificates for
  [Fluid Attacks](https://fluidattacks.com/)
  are renewed every 30 days
  in order to minimize leaks.

- We use the
  [HSTS](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security)
  policy to ensure that every connection
  to our domain goes through
  [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS).

- We demand all connections to support
  at least TLSv1.2.

- [Attack Surface Managerâ€™s (ASM)](https://app.fluidattacks.com/)
  database uses TLSv1.2
  for in transit protection.

- We possess fully dedicated network channels
  with some of our biggest clients,
  allowing us to isolate all unwanted traffic.
  This is especially useful for running
  secure dynamic application hacking.

- For the rest of our clients,
  we use fully encrypted VPNs.

- [Ephemeral environments](../integrity/developing-integrity#ephemeral-environments)
  always include a digital certificate,
  validated with ACME protocol, and
  [not self-signed](/criteria/requirements/092).
