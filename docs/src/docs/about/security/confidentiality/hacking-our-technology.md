We have projects focused
on hacking our software.
It is essential for us
to be an example of secure software.
That's why
our entire technology stack
goes through a process
of comprehensive
[Continuous Hacking](https://fluidattacks.com/services/continuous-hacking/).

All our development projects run
[Continuous Integration](https://docs.fluidattacks.com/about/security/integrity/developing-integrity#continuous-integration)
pipelines,
including exploits and strict linters,
to ensure that
[no known vulnerabilities](/criteria/requirements/155)
are released to production.
