We have projects focused
on hacking our software.
It is essential for us
to be an example of secure software.
That's why
our entire technology stack
goes through a process
of comprehensive
[Continuous Hacking](https://fluidattacks.com/services/continuous-hacking/).

All our development projects run
[Continuous Integration](https://docs.fluidattacks.com/about/security/integrity/developing-integrity#continuous-integration)
pipelines,
including exploits and strict linters,
to ensure that
[no known vulnerabilities](/criteria/requirements/155)
are released to production.

Additionally,
we run [a bug bounty program](https://www.openbugbounty.org/bugbounty/fluidattacks/)
to ensure the highest security
and privacy of our websites.
Everyone is eligible to participate in the bug bounty program,
and people is encouraged to find
and responsibly report vulnerabilities
through a monetary award
based on the impact of the vulnerability.
