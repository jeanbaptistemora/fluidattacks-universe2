In an effort to be transparent
and keep stakeholders informed,
we report all news and incidents
related to our software
on our
[News site](https://news.fluidattacks.com/?label=15603).

Each incident report contains the following items:

- **What happened**
- **What we have done**
- **What the impact was**
- **What we are doing to help**
