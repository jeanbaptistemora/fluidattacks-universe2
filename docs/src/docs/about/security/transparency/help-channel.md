In order to have a direct communication channel with our clients
and keep them informed in case of any doubt,
we support an email ticket system (help@fluidattacks.com).
We treat tickets as confidential information,
and only support engineers within `Fluid Attacks` can see them.

Anyone can send us any concern or request,
and our engineers will contact them
within the next twenty-four hours.
