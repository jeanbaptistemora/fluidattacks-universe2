The source code of all our applications
is available to the entire Internet.
The security pros of having open source code are:

1. **Auditability:** Public code can be audited by anyone on the internet,
  this means that in order to keep our business secure,
  we must be careful with the quality of the published source code.
  Common bad practices like backdoors,
  exposed secrets,
  or using vulnerable dependencies,
  are avoided in order to keep
  our software as secure as possible.
2. **Transparency:** The full history of our source code can be found
   [here](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/product/-/commits/master).
   By publishing it,
   we allow any interested parties
   to know exactly what we're fixing,
   improving or adding to our software.
