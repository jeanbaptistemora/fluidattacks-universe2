In cases where `Fluid Attacks` detects a breach,
emails are sent to notify the involved parties.
These emails contain information on:

1. What data was leaked or compromised.
1. When the data was leaked or compromised.
1. For how long the data was leaked or compromised
  (to the extent that this information is available).

For a breach that exposes private data
of a large number of users,
the public will also be informed via email.
