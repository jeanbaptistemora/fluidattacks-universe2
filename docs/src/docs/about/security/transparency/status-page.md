We continuously monitor our main systems:

- [Attack Surface Manager (ASM)](https://app.fluidattacks.com/)
- [GraphQL API](https://app.fluidattacks.com/api)
- [Website](https://fluidattacks.com/)

In doing so,
we let all interested parties,
including our developers,
know the availability status of such systems.
Monitoring checks are run on servers
in North America and Europe
every minute for all applications.
This information is real-time
and available on our
[Status Page](https://status.fluidattacks.com/).
