Our collaboration systems
also provide security requirements
that mobile devices must comply with
before enrolling in the organizationâ€™s systems.
This is especially useful,
as personal mobile devices
are common targets for malicious hackers.

Some of the requirements are:

- Having a separate working profile for isolating information
  from the rest of the phone.
- Setting a strong passphrase.
- Setting
  [biometric authentication](/criteria/authentication/231)
  in case the device supports it.
