Our collaboration systems
also provide security requirements
that mobile devices must comply with
before enrolling in the organization's systems.
This is especially useful
as personal mobile devices are common targets
for malicious hackers.

Some of the requirements are the following:

- Having a separate work profile
  to isolate the information
  from the rest of the phone.
- Establishing a strong passphrase.
- Setting [biometric authentication](/criteria/requirements/231)
  in case the device supports it.

## Requirements

- [205. Configure PIN](/criteria/requirements/205)
- [213. Allow geographic location](/criteria/requirements/213)
- [231. Implement a biometric verification component](/criteria/requirements/231)
- [326. Detect rooted devices](/criteria/requirements/326)
- [329. Keep client-side storage without sensitive data](/criteria/requirements/329)
- [373. Use certificate pinning](/criteria/requirements/373)
