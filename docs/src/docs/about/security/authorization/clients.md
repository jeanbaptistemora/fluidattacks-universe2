Our [Attack Surface Manager (ASM)](https://app.fluidattacks.com/)
has a set of necessary
[roles](/criteria/requirements/096)
for every hacking project.

Once the client decides
which members of their team should be **project managers**,
`Fluid Attacks` assigns them the role,
providing them
the [ability to give](/criteria/requirements/035)
the [minimum required permissions](/criteria/requirements/186)
to other members of their team.

Some of the available roles are hacker,
admin, releaser, escaper,
user and project manager.
