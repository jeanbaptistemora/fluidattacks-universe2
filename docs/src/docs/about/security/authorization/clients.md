Our [Attack Surface Manager (ASM)](https://app.fluidattacks.com/)
has a set of
[roles](/criteria/requirements/authorization/096)
that are necessary for every hacking project.

Once the client decides
which members of their team should be **project managers**,
`Fluid Attacks` assigns the role to them,
providing them with the
[ability to assign](/criteria/requirements/authorization/035) the
[minimum required permissions](/criteria/requirements/system/186)
to other members of their team.

Some of the available roles are *hacker*, *admin*,
*releaser*, *escaper*, *user* and *project manager*.
