All our infrastructure is decentralized,
meaning that we have independent data centers
spread across multiple regions.
No hardware maintenance
or updates are needed
as they are done by a third party.
[Attack Surface Manager (ASM)](https://app.fluidattacks.com/)
database does not need to be updated
as new releases are immediatly used
and are always backward-compatible.
No local networks are used.
We only use Wifi connections with
SSO authentication based on our IAM
and with the sole purpose of accessing the Internet.
Connections are always encrypted
[using WPA2-AES](/criteria/requirements/252).
