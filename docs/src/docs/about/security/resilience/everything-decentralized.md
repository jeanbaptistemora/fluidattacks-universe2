All our infrastructure is decentralized,
meaning that we have independent data centers
spread across multiple regions.
No hardware maintenance is needed
as it is done by a third party.
No local networks are used.
We only use Wifi connections with
SSO authentication based on our IAM
and with the sole purpose of accessing the Internet.
Connections are always encrypted
[using WPA2-AES](/criteria/requirements/networks/252).
