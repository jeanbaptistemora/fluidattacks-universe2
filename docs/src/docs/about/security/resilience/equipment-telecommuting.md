[BYOD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_your_own_device)
(bring your own device) is not allowed.
Every employee receives a computer
with a password-secured BIOS,
[TPM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/about/security/information-protection/tpm/trusted-platform-module-overview)
(Trusted Platform Module)
hardware, and
[biometric fingerprint reader](/criteria/requirements/231).
Going to the office is the rule,
but employees can always fill out an exception form
to telework if needed.
In case our offices close
(e.g., due to the
[COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) pandemic),
everyone can still do their job seamlessly.

Additionally,
all machines are remotely controlled
using [Windows CSP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/configuration-service-provider-reference),
allowing us to easily implement remote actions
like restricting administrative privileges,
updating the operating system monthly,
executing code,
formatting the computer,
among many others.
