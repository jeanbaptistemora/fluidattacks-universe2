[BYOD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_your_own_device)
is not allowed.
Every employee receives a computer
with a password-secured BIOS,
[TPM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/about/security/information-protection/tpm/trusted-platform-module-overview)
hardware, and
[biometric fingerprint reader](/criteria/requirements/231).
Going to the office is the rule,
but employees can always fill out an exception form
to telework in case they need to.
In case our offices close (e.g., due to
[COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) pandemic),
everyone can still do their job seamlessly.

Aditionally,
all machines are remotely controlled
using [Windows CSP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/configuration-service-provider-reference),
allowing us to easily implement
remote actions like
restrincting administrative privileges,
updating the operating system in a monthly basis,
executing code,
formatting the computer,
among many others.
