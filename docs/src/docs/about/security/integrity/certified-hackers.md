We continuously encourage our hackers
to certify their knowledge.
Usually,
hackers start applying for certificates
after spending six (6) months in the company.

[Here](https://fluidattacks.com/about-us/certifications/)
you can find a comprehensive list
of certifications that our team of hackers currently holds.
