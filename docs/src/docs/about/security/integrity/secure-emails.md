The [`Fluid Attacks` domain](https://fluidattacks.com/)
has DKIM and SPF protocols enabled.
Additionally,
it has the DMARCv1 protocol enabled
in verbose mode
for running advanced diagnostics.
These protocols help email recipients
verify if an email comes from a trusted source,
thus helping them avoid phishing
and fake emails.
