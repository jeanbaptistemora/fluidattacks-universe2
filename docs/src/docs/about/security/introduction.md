As a security company,
`Fluid Attacks` is aware of the importance of

- having honesty, teamwork,
  and discipline as immovable principles
  (our full manifest can be found
  [here](https://fluidattacks.com/about-us/values/));

- developing products
  that comply with the highest worldwide
  [security standards](/criteria/requirements/);

- acquiring only
  [compliant services and products for internal use](/criteria/requirements/226);

- implementing best security practices
  within our organization;

- being completely transparent with our clients,
  especially regarding their data:
  [how we use it and what we do to protect it](/criteria/requirements/315).

These principles,
conceived from the early days of the company,
have allowed us to implement a large number of measures
throughout the years.
On this page,
we will mention those
that provide the highest value to our customers
in terms of security.
