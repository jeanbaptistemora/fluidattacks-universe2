One of the most common questions
about Fluid Attacks' Continuous Hacking
(Squad Plan or Machine Plan)
is how it compares to SOOS's services.
The following comparison table
allows you to understand
how both providers perform on different attributes
that may be essential to meet your company's cybersecurity needs.
