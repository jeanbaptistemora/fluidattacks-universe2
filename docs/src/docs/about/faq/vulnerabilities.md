### What is a vulnerability?
A vulnerability is
anything that represents a security risk
(Integrity, Availability,
Confidentiality, Non-repudiation)
to the application.

### How is the score of a vulnerability calculated?
Fluid Attacks uses
[CVSS](/about/glossary#cvss)
(Common Vulnerability Scoring System),
a “standardized framework
used to rate the severity
of security vulnerabilities in software.”
It gives us a quantitative measure
ranging from `0` to `10`,
`0` being the lowest level of risk
and `10` the highest
and most critical level of risk,
based on the qualitative characteristics
of a vulnerability.

### Do I get all the information about my vulnerabilities?
Continuous Hacking has an interactive reporting platform,
our Attack Surface Manager (`ASM`).
`ASM` gives all project stakeholders
access to details concerning vulnerabilities
reported by `Fluid Attacks`.
(We have the source code of all our
[products](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/product)
in our
[public repository](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks).)

### What happens when a vulnerability is reported?
After a report,
the main objective for developers
is to eliminate the vulnerability.
Through `ASM`,
a client company’s developers
can access first-hand detailed information
regarding a vulnerability
in order to plan
and execute corrective measures
to remove it from the application.

### What happens when a vulnerability is remediated?
Through `ASM`,
any user with access to the project
can request verification
of a remediated vulnerability.
A request for verification
that a remediated vulnerability
no longer poses a risk
must be accompanied
by notification from you
that the planned remediation
has been executed.
We then perform a closing verification
to confirm the effectiveness
of the remediation.
Results of the closing verification
are then forwarded
to the project team by email.

### How many closing verifications are included in the Squad plan?
The Squad plan offers
unlimited closing verifications.

### If you have access to the repository, why should I notify you when a vulnerability is remediated?
One of the Squad plan's objectives
is to maintain clear 
nd effortless communication
between all project members.
This is accomplished
when you notify us
because the message goes through `ASM`
and by doing so,
the entire project team is notified.

### What happens if I do not consider something a vulnerability?
Within `ASM` there is a comment section.
A client company can post its reasons
for believing a vulnerability finding
is not valid.
Our experts and all other project members
can then interface and discuss
the relative merits
of the vulnerability finding
as well as the validity of it
as a security risk,
and a final determination can be made.

### Do all reported vulnerabilities have to be remediated?
No.
However,
this decision is made entirely by the client,
not by us,
and the client assumes all responsibility
for possible negative impacts
of non-remediation.
In `ASM`,
under the treatment option,
a client company indicates
whether it will remediate
or assume responsibility
for an identified vulnerability.

### If a client does not remediate a vulnerability, is it excluded from ASM?
No.
Reports and `ASM`
include information regarding all vulnerabilities,
along with whether vulnerabilities
were remediated or not.
Reports and `ASM`
will include all the information
with nothing excluded.

### Do you keep information regarding the vulnerabilities found?
Information is only kept
for the duration of the contract.
Once the contract has ended,
information is kept for
`7` business days
and then deleted
from all our information systems.

### How will our data be erased?
`ASM` uses an automated erasing process,
removing all the project information
from our systems
and generating a `Proof of Delivery`
signed via `Docusign`.
