## What is a vulnerability?

A vulnerability is anything
that represents a security risk
(integrity, availability,
confidentiality, non-repudiation)
for the application.

## How is the score of a vulnerability calculated?

`Fluid Attacks` uses [CVSS](/about/glossary#cvss)
(Common Vulnerability Scoring System),
a "standardized framework
used to rate the severity
of security vulnerabilities in software."
It gives us a quantitative measure
ranging from **0 to 10**,
0 being the lowest level of risk
and 10 the highest
and most critical level of risk,
based on the qualitative characteristics
of a vulnerability.

## Do I get all the information about my vulnerabilities?

[Continuous Hacking](https://fluidattacks.com/services/continuous-hacking/)
has an interactive reporting platform,
our Attack Surface Manager
([ASM](https://fluidattacks.com/categories/asm/)).
ASM gives all project stakeholders access
to details concerning vulnerabilities
reported by `Fluid Attacks`.
(We have the source code
of all our [products](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/product)
in our [public repository](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks).)

## What happens when a vulnerability is reported?

After a report,
the main objective for developers
is to eliminate the vulnerability.
Through ASM,
a client company's developers
can access detailed first-hand information
regarding a vulnerability
in order to plan
and execute corrective measures
to remove it from the application.

## What happens when a vulnerability is remediated?

Through ASM,
any user with access to the project
can request verification
of a remediated vulnerability.
A request for verification
that a remediated vulnerability no longer poses a risk
must be accompanied by notification from you
that the planned remediation has been executed.
We then perform a closing verification
to confirm the effectiveness of the remediation.
Results of the closing verification
are then forwarded
to the project team by email.

## How many closing verifications are included in the Squad Plan?

The Squad Plan offers unlimited closing verifications.

## If you can access my repo, why notify you about a remediated vulnerability?

One of the Squad Plan's objectives
is to maintain clear and effortless communication
between all project members.
This is accomplished
when you notify us
because the message goes
through [ASM](https://fluidattacks.com/categories/asm/)
and by doing so,
the entire project team is notified.

## What happens if I do not consider something a vulnerability?

Within ASM,
there is a comment section.
A client company can post its reasons
for believing a vulnerability finding is not valid.
Our experts
and all other project members
can then interface and discuss
the relative merits of the vulnerability finding
as well as its validity
as a security risk,
in order to make a final decision.

## Do all reported vulnerabilities have to be remediated?

No.
However,
this decision is made entirely by the client,
not by us,
and the client assumes all responsibility
for possible negative impacts of non-remediation.
In ASM,
under the treatment option,
a client company indicates
whether it will remediate
or assume responsibility
for an identified vulnerability.

## If a client does not remediate a vulnerability, is it excluded from ASM?

No.
Reports and ASM include information
regarding all vulnerabilities,
along with whether vulnerabilities were remediated
or not.

## Do you keep information regarding the discovered vulnerabilities?

Information is only kept
for the duration of the contract.
Once the contract has ended,
information is kept for **seven business days**
and then deleted
from all our information systems.

## How will our data be erased?

[ASM](https://fluidattacks.com/categories/asm/)
uses an automated erasing process,
removing all the project information
from our systems
and generating a Proof of Delivery
signed via Docusign.
