### Is it possible to schedule follow-up meetings?
Yes.
All applications covered by the contract
for Continuous Hacking
are assigned to a specific project leader
who is available to attend all necessary meetings.
We simply require sufficient notice
of an impending meeting
in order to schedule availability.

### Does the Squad plan generate reports?
We generate and deliver,
through `ASM`,
a technical report
available in `Excel` and/or `PDF` format
during the execution
of the project contract.
Once the project ends,
`ASM` delivers a presentation
and an executive report,
also in `PDF` format.

### How do I communicate with you?
For the Squad plan,
communication takes place
between developers and hackers
on a day-to-day basis
via ASM.
In One-shot Hacking,
communication is handled
through the project manager (PM)
as a single point of contact (SPOC).
