### Is it possible to schedule follow-up meetings?
Yes.
All applications covered by the contract
for Continuous Hacking
are assigned to a specific project leader
who is available to attend all necessary meetings.
We simply require sufficient notice
of an impending meeting
in order to schedule availability.

### Does the Squad plan generate reports?
We generate and deliver,
through `ASM`,
a technical report
available in `Excel` and/or `PDF` format
during the execution
of the project contract.
Once the project ends,
`ASM` delivers a presentation
and an executive report,
also in `PDF` format.

### How do I communicate with you?
For the Squad plan,
communication takes place
between developers and hackers
on a day-to-day basis
via ASM.
In One-shot Hacking,
communication is handled
through the project manager (PM)
as a single point of contact (SPOC).

### How long does it take you to answer a question in the comment system?
All questions made through
the vulnerabilities comment system,
have a `4` business hours `SLA`.
M - F from `8AM` to `12` noon
and `2PM` to `6PM`
(`UTC-5` Colombia =
same as Eastern Standard Time `USA`).
`SLA` is not contractually defined,
it is our value promise.

### Will you periodically do presentations via teleconferencing?
Yes.
We can schedule periodic presentations
via teleconferencing.
To set up a teleconference presentation,
you will need to provide us
with the emails of attendees
and `3` optional time periods
of `1-hour` duration
for the teleconference.
We will then notify you
of the best time for the teleconference
based on your availability and ours,
and send emails to your list of attendees
inviting them to participate.

### Do I lose my property rights if you review my source code?
No.
Reviewing your code
in no way compromises
your proprietary rights
to that code.

### Who would be performing the work?
Our designated team of hackers.

### Can I see your resumes??
Yes,
you can access
the LinkedIn profiles
of some members of our team
on our people page.

### What certifications do you have?
Please refer to our
[certifications](https://fluidattacks.com/about-us/certifications/)
page for further information.

### Do you have liability insurance?
Yes,
`1M USD` coverage.
