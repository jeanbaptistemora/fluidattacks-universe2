### Is it possible to schedule follow-up meetings?
Yes.
All applications covered by the contract
for Continuous Hacking
are assigned to a specific project leader
who is available to attend all necessary meetings.
We simply require sufficient notice
of an impending meeting
in order to schedule availability.
