## What information is needed in order to provide a quotation?

To provide a proposal,
we need to determine
what the target of evaluation (scope) will be.
So,
we require the following information:

1. *One-shot hacking* (by project):

  a. How many ports are included in the scope?

  b. How many inputs of applications
  are included in the scope?

  c. How many `LoC` are included in the scope?
  We recommend running
  [`CLOC`](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc)
  in order to facilitate quantification.

**Note:**
It would be desirable to obtain
the access credentials
(standard user, not privileges)
to the applications in cases
where this will be included.

1. **Continuous hacking** (`SDLC`):
  Under this model,
  we need to know how many active authors
  will be involved in the project.

Regarding the health check estimation,
the same considerations apply
as for one-shot hacking,
so the client should provide
the above-mentioned information as well.
