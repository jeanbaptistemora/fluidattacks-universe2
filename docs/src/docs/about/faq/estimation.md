## What information is needed in order to provide a quotation?

To provide a quotation,
we need to determine the target of evaluation (scope).
So,
we require the following information:

[**One-Shot Hacking**](https://fluidattacks.com/services/one-shot-hacking/)
  (by project):

- How many ports are included in the scope?

- How many inputs of applications
  are included in the scope?

- How many LoC are included in the scope?
  We recommend running
  [CLOC](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc)
  in order to facilitate quantification.

- It would be desirable to obtain the access credentials
  (standard user, not privileges)
  to the applications
  in cases where this will be included.

[**Continuous Hacking**](https://fluidattacks.com/services/continuous-hacking/)
  (SDLC):
  Under this model,
  we need to know how many active authors
  will be involved in the project.

Regarding the Health Check estimation,
the same considerations apply as for One-Shot Hacking,
so the client should also provide the mentioned information.
