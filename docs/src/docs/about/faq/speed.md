### When does Continuous Hacking begin?
Continuous Hacking begins
immediately after receiving
the purchase order.

### Does Continuous Hacking use a series of automated tools or is it the result of a manual (by hand) process?
Automated tools,
by themselves,
are not capable of extracting
sensitive business information,
such as client or employee information.
In our Continuous Hacking service,
we use a series of tools
which are acquired and developed
by us at `Fluid Attacks`,
as well as a detailed review process
performed by our expert technical staff.
We go the extra mile
because automated tools present
the following problems:

1. Vulnerability leakages
(detection of a minimal percentage
of existing security risk vulnerabilities).

1. Detected vulnerabilities
are primarily false positives.

1. Incapability of combining
individual vulnerabilities
in order to reveal
additional vulnerabilities
which may be an even greater security risk
than the individual vulnerabilities alone.

### If Continuous Hacking includes a manual review, how does Fluid Attacks ensure that development cycles are not slowed down?
Continuous Hacking is first performed
on the source code.
This allows for hacking
and development to occur simultaneously,
which in turn minimizes
the dependency on functional environments,
as well as the need for coordination
between hackers and developers.
The decisions regarding
which findings are prioritized
for each sprint rest solely
with the client.
Unless we are dealing
with a company
with daily `CI/CD`
(Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment),
not all sprints generate code
eligible for release and deployment,
which improves the remediation (repair) time
for detected vulnerabilities.

### If Continuous Hacking is done manually, how can a big project move rapidly and expand as more active authors (developers) join the team?
Standard Continuous Hacking
covers `95%` of all business applications
being developed,
as the subscription is
based on the number of active developers in the project
and this defines the amount of resources
assigned to the project.

### If Continuous Hacking is done manually, how does it move rapidly when a client has a big application portfolio that is constantly increasing?
Based on our historical data,
and thanks to our recruitment
and training capabilities,
as well as our ability
to innovate internal processes,
we are fully capable of taking on
between `5` and `10` new applications each month.
