### When does the Squad plan hacking begin?
It begins immediately after
receiving the purchase order.

### How is a project’s progress determined?
A project’s progress
and current state
is determined
using the following metrics: 

- Source code coverage indicator.
- Percentage of remediated (repaired)
  security risk vulnerabilities.

### Does the Squad plan use automated tools or is it a manual process?
Automated tools,
by themselves,
are not capable of extracting
sensitive business information,
such as client or employee information.
In our Squad plan service,
we use a series of tools
which are acquired and developed
by us at `Fluid Attacks`,
as well as a detailed review process
performed by our expert technical staff.
We go the extra mile
because automated tools present
the following problems:

1. Vulnerability leakages
(detection of a minimal percentage
of existing security risk vulnerabilities).

1. Detected vulnerabilities
are primarily false positives.

1. Incapability of combining
individual vulnerabilities
in order to reveal
additional vulnerabilities
which may be an even greater security risk
than the individual vulnerabilities alone.

### How are development cycles not slowed down by manual reviews?
The Squad plan hacking
is first performed
on the source code.
This allows for hacking
and development to occur simultaneously,
which in turn minimizes
the dependency on functional environments,
as well as the need for coordination
between hackers and developers.
The decisions regarding
which findings are prioritized
for each sprint rest solely
with the client.
Unless we are dealing
with a company
with daily `CI/CD`
(Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment),
not all sprints generate code
eligible for release and deployment,
which improves the remediation (repair) time
for detected vulnerabilities.

### How does a big project with many developers move rapidly with the Squad plan's manual reviews?
Standard Squad plan hacking
covers `95%` of all business applications
being developed,
as the subscription is
based on the number of active developers in the project
and this defines the amount of resources
assigned to the project.

### How can the Squad plan's manual review keep up with a client's big and growing application portfolio?
Based on our historical data,
and thanks to our recruitment
and training capabilities,
as well as our ability
to innovate internal processes,
we are fully capable of taking on
between `5` and `10` new applications each month.
