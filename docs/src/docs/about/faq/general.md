### What is a vulnerability?
A vulnerability is
anything that represents a security risk
(Integrity, Availability,
Confidentiality, Non-repudiation)
to the application.

### How is the score of a vulnerability calculated?
Fluid Attacks uses
[CVSS](/about/glossary#cvss)
(Common Vulnerability Scoring System),
a “standardized framework
used to rate the severity
of security vulnerabilities in software.”
It gives us a quantitative measure
ranging from `0` to `10`,
`0` being the lowest level of risk
and `10` the highest
and most critical level of risk,
based on the qualitative characteristics
of a vulnerability.

### What is Continuous Hacking?
Continuous Hacking is
a security testing service
that allows the hacking process
to begin at an early stage
in the software development cycle.
Its purpose is to guarantee
`100%` testing coverage of the application.


### What are the benefits of the Squad plan?
Our Squad plan offers
Continuous Hacking:
1. Minimizes the cost of remediation (repair)
of a vulnerable security risk
while the software is in development
rather than when it is in production.

1. Reduces application certification time to zero
because the hacking is done during development.

1. Provides clear and detailed information
about vulnerable security risks
and facilitates a coordinated effort
between external project personnel
(`Fluid Attacks` experts)
identifying security risks,
and internal project personnel
(client company)
fixing security issues without delays.

### Do I get all the information about my vulnerabilities?
Continuous Hacking has an interactive reporting platform,
our Attack Surface Manager (`ASM`).
`ASM` gives all project stakeholders
access to details concerning vulnerabilities
reported by `Fluid Attacks`.
(We have the source code of all our
[products](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/product)
in our
[public repository](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks).)

### In what industries does your company have experience?
Along our career trajectory
we have been working with companies
from different sectors,
such as financial, transportation,
industrial, consumer, communications,
technology and utilities.

### Is it possible to hire an On-the-Premises Squad plan?
No.
Due to the operational model
that supports the Squad plan,
it can only be done remotely.

### At 100% coverage, is the Squad plan suspended until new changes are added?
No.
Even if 100% of coverage is reached,
we continue checking
already attacked source code
to identify any possible false negatives,
including components developed
by third parties in our hacking process.

### When does the Squad plan end?
The Sqad plan is contracted
for a minimum of `12` months
and is renewed automatically
at the end of the `12-month` time period.
the Squad plan ends
when we receive a written request
through previously defined channels
to terminate the contract.

### Can the contract be canceled at anytime?
You can cancel your contract
at any time after the fourth month.
Cancellation can be requested
through any communication channel
previously defined in the contract.

### What happens when a vulnerability is reported?
After a report,
the main objective for developers
is to eliminate the vulnerability.
Through `ASM`,
a client company’s developers
can access first-hand detailed information
regarding a vulnerability
in order to plan
and execute corrective measures
to remove it from the application.
