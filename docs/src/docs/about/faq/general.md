### What is a vulnerability?
A vulnerability is
anything that represents a security risk
(Integrity, Availability,
Confidentiality, Non-repudiation)
to the application.

### What is Continuous Hacking?
Continuous Hacking is
a security testing service
that allows the hacking process
to begin at an early stage
in the software development cycle.
Its purpose is to guarantee
`100%` testing coverage of the application.


### What are the benefits of Continuous Hacking?
Continuous Hacking:
1. Minimizes the cost of remediation (repair)
of a vulnerable security risk
while the software is in development
rather than when it is in production.

1. Reduces application certification time to zero
because the hacking is done during development.

1. Provides clear and detailed information
about vulnerable security risks
and facilitates a coordinated effort
between external project personnel
(`Fluid Attacks` experts)
identifying security risks,
and internal project personnel
(client company)
fixing security issues without delays.

### In what industries does Fluid Attacks have experience?
Along our career trajectory
we have been working with companies
from different sectors,
such as financial, transportation,
industrial, consumer, communications,
technology and utilities.

### Is it possible to hire On-the-Premises Continuous Hacking?
No.
Due to the operational model
that supports Continuous Hacking,
it can only be done remotely.
