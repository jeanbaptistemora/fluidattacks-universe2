### What is Continuous Hacking?
Continuous Hacking is
a security testing service
that allows the hacking process
to begin at an early stage
in the software development cycle.
Its purpose is to guarantee
`100%` testing coverage of the application.


### What are the benefits of the Squad plan?
Our Squad plan offers
Continuous Hacking:
1. Minimizes the cost of remediation (repair)
of a vulnerable security risk
while the software is in development
rather than when it is in production.

1. Reduces application certification time to zero
because the hacking is done during development.

1. Provides clear and detailed information
about vulnerable security risks
and facilitates a coordinated effort
between external project personnel
(`Fluid Attacks` experts)
identifying security risks,
and internal project personnel
(client company)
fixing security issues without delays.

### In what industries does your company have experience?
Along our career trajectory
we have been working with companies
from different sectors,
such as financial, transportation,
industrial, consumer, communications,
technology and utilities.

### Is it possible to hire an On-the-Premises Squad plan?
No.
Due to the operational model
that supports the Squad plan,
it can only be done remotely.

### At 100% coverage, is the Squad plan suspended until new changes are added?
No.
Even if 100% of coverage is reached,
we continue checking
already attacked source code
to identify any possible false negatives,
including components developed
by third parties in our hacking process.

### When does the Squad plan end?
The Sqad plan is contracted
for a minimum of `12` months
and is renewed automatically
at the end of the `12-month` time period.
the Squad plan ends
when we receive a written request
through previously defined channels
to terminate the contract.

### Can the contract be canceled at anytime?
You can cancel your contract
at any time after the fourth month.
Cancellation can be requested
through any communication channel
previously defined in the contract.

### Can the Squad plan be used for code developed a long time ago?
Yes,
it is still possible
to use the Squad plan.
There are two
options available:

1. A Health Check can be performed
testing all existing code.
Then,
the Squad plan is executed as usual
within the defined scope
(see [this question](/about/faq/speed#how-are-development-cycles-not-slowed-down-by-manual-reviews)).
This option is better suited
for applications under development.

2. Start with the standard limits
(see [this question](/about/faq/speed#does-the-squad-plan-use-automated-tools-or-is-it-a-manual-process)),
increasing the coverage
on a monthly basis
until 100% is reached.
This option is better suited
for applications
no longer in development.

### What can be done to review all the existing code before starting the hacking process?
We recommend
that application development
and the hacking process
begin simultaneously.
However,
this is not always possible.
To catch up with developers,
we perform a `Health Check`
(additional fees apply).
This means all versions of the existing code
are attacked
up to the contracted starting point
in addition to the monthly test limit.
This allows us to catch up
with the development team
within the first `3` contract months.
Then,
we continue hacking simultaneously
with the development team
as development continues.

### What if I want the Squad plan but not the Health Check?
This is a risky choice.
Not performing a Health Check
means there will be code
that is never going to be tested and,
therefore,
it’s not possible to know
what vulnerabilities may exist in it;
those vulnerabilities
are not going to be identified.
We guarantee
that `100%` of the code change
is going to be tested,
but what cannot be reached,
cannot be tested.

## Who would be performing the work?
Our designated team of hackers.

### Can we see resumes?
Yes,
you can access
the LinkedIn profiles
of some members of our team
on our people page.

### What certifications do you have?
Please refer to our
[certifications](https://fluidattacks.com/about-us/certifications/)
page for further information.

### With the Squad plan, is it possible to include the infrastructure associated with my app?
We have improved the Squad plan model
to now include infrastructure
within the Target of Evaluation (`ToE`).
This includes the application’s ports,
inputs, infrastructure,
and of course
the application itself.

### What external tools do you use to perform pentesting?
We use [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp)
for web testing,
and [CANVAS](https://www.immunityinc.com/products/canvas/)
and [Core Impact](https://www.coresecurity.com/products/core-impact)
for infrastructure testing
with additional exploits.

### How will our data be transmitted?
It is up to you,
however,
we recommend the use of `HTTPS`
for application tests
and `SSH` (`git`)
for source code analysis.
