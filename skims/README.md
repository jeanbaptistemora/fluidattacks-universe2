As a cybersecurity product we want to make the world a safer place

We do this by:

- Reporting only true positives

You can help us achieve these goals by the following means:
- Telling your friends
- Using the product
- Creating [issues](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/product/-/issues) with ideas, feature requests,
  problems, use cases, or feedback
- Helping us solve those issues

Code contributions or direct bug fixes can be submitted as a patch to
