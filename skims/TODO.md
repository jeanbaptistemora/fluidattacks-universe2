- Test if the following rules are a vulnerability and include them
    - cfn_nag W43 IAM role should not have AdministratorAccess policy
    - cfn_nag F6 IAM role should not allow Allow+NotPrincipal in its trust policy
    - cfn_nag F10 IAM user should not have any inline policies.  Should be centralized Policy object on group
    - cfn_nag F11 IAM policy should not apply directly to users.  Should be on group
    - cfn_nag F12 IAM managed policy should not apply directly to users.  Should be on group
- Add an HCL2 parser with line number
- Keyboard interrupts in production environment affect stability,
  we should intercept them with a sys-handler
- Yaml implementations are vulnerable to RCE so we should:
    - Fork the libraries and patch them, or
    - Avoid using yaml, for instance in the config file
