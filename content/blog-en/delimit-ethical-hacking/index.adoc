:description: When security flaws are found through an ethical hacking it is important to delimit the scope of the objectives. An ethical hacking can be centered on three aspects: Application, Infrastructure and Source Code. Knowing this, it is possible to establish the target of evaluation for the test.

= How to properly delimit an Ethical Hacking?

The main problem encountered by an organization
when they need to perform security testing
is establishing the boundaries of the test.

Delimiting the scope of a Pentest by time
is a common mistake
since it is not possible to know when a test,
that is measured solely by effort,
has ended nor whether the results were satisfactory
or if it was just a big waste of time and resources
that left no valuable knowledge to the organization.

There are two objectives to evaluate in an Ethical Hacking,
infrastructure and application.
These two can be evaluated in an already deployed environment or in a development one
analyzing the source code.

If what the organization wants is to identify vulnerabilities
in their applications(web/mobile) and web services
based on the needs and context of the business,
in order to generate the biggest business impact possible,
an Ethical Hacking of Applications should be done.

If what the organization wants is to detect security flaws
directly in the development,
identifying bad programming practices
and intentional errors in the source code
that can affect the proper functioning of the system,
a Source Code Analysis should be done.

Finally,
if what is needed are tests on the underlying infrastructure
of the systems (Network services/OS),
looking to exploit specific vulnerabilities of the implemented technology,
an Ethical Hacking of the Infrastructure should be done.

Once the type of test to be performed is decided,
the Target of Evaluation or ToE has to be determined
based on three items.

* **Number of Ports**,
If what is going to be evaluated is Infrastructure.

* **Number of Input Fields**,
If the target of the test is the application.

* **Lines of Code**,
If the risks associated to the development wished to be determined.

Once these scopes are set and clear,
one can be assured that everything related to that technology
will be tested,
as opposed to delimitations that are set based on execution time
with automated tools that only
exploit a small percentage of the reported vulnerabilities.

In FLUID,
our value proposition goes hand in hand with meeting the promised scope,
never based on time.
Our tests are said to be finished when we have evaluated
the complete target of evaluation.
