= Storing passwords safely

By the end of the year, we witnessed a huge increase in the amount of attacks
that extracted large quantities of personal information, emails and passwords.
Even one of the biggest email services, Yahoo, suffered an attack by
cyber-criminals and they robbed more than 500000 accounts, in doing so,
accessing to everyone’s passwords. One of the most common methods of storing
passwords on rest is hashing, it’s a mathematical function that transforms data
into a fixed-length value or key that represents the original data.

You can use hashing algorithms to reinforce integrity and also to store 
passwords, as long as the data never changes. The resulting hash will always be
the same. By comparing hashes created at two different times you can determine
if the original data is still the same. Passwords are often stored as hashes,
when a user creates a new password, the system calculates the hash and stores
it. Later, when a user logs-in, the system calculates the hash of the password
entered and compare it with the one stored, if it is the same then the person
entered the correct password. The most common hashing algorithms are MD5
(Message Digest 5), SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) and HMAC (Hash-based Message
Authentication Code).

However, hashing has a vulnerability, rainbow tables. Which are huge databases
of precomputed hashes, and it helps crackers to discover passwords comparing 
thehash of a stolen password with the database. Some of these tables are bigger
that 160 GB in size, and they include hashes for almost every possible
combination of characters.

== Challenge Yashira Hash 3

In this challenge, they give us a hash that needs to be cracked, and then 
answered it with the password on clear text.

We could use a rainbow table to crack this hash but it will need a huge 
database or an algorithm that uses every hash and password to compare. On the 
contrary, we could use https://crackstation.net/[crackstation] to do this task. 
It only needs the hash and the site cracks it with its own database.

It then discovers the clear text password of the hash given, telling us that it
is SHA1. It uses colors to indicate if the search was successful, if a partial 
a partial match was found or if no password was found at all

To protect against these types of attacks, developers and systems 
administrators should add security measures additional to hash such as salt. 
Salting passwords prevent rainbow table attacks adding a set of random data at 
the end of the password before hashing it. These additional characters add 
complexity to the password and cause that password attacks that compare hashes 
to fail. Some of the common methods of salting are Bcrypt and PBKDF2 
(Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2).
