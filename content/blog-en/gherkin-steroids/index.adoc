= Gherkin on steroids

In the field of information security
and ethical hacking,
'finding all vulnerabilities'
is as important as
'reporting them as soon as possible'.
For that, we need an effective means to communicate
with all stakeholders.
We have proposed
link:../app-pickle-document-gherkin/[before]
using the
link:https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BusinessReadableDSL.html[bussiness-readable, domain-specific language]
+Gherkin+.
In that entry, we showed how to use +Gherkin+'s syntax
in order to document attack vectors,
i.e. how to find and exploit vulnerabilities in an app.
We also showed the basics of the language,
so if you haven't done so already,
we recommend you to take a look a it.

== Syntax recap

In that article we mentioned
multi-line arguments only in passing.
Sometimes you need to specify a larger piece of text
as input or output to a program
than fits in a
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_per_line#In_programming[decent-length line]
that already includes more text.
If you want to document that in +Gherkin+,
you may use +Python+-like +docstrings+ (+"""+):

.Specifying long input
[source,gherkin]
----
When I inject the following SQL query in the input field:
  """
  INSERT INTO mysql.user (user, host, password)
         VALUES ('name', 'localhost', PASSWORD('pass123'))
  """
Then I have granted myself access to the database
----

You may write anything between the +docstrings+,
but they must be in their own lines and
the indentation is relative to them.
They are particularly useful for citing code,
output from +CLI+ programs and
unstructured plain text.

For 'structured' plain text,
+Gherkin+ has the
+Data Table+ syntax element,
(don't confuse with tables from Scenario Outlines):

//.Tabular data with tables
[source,gherkin]
----
Given the database is populated with the species:
| Common Name    | Genus  | Species  | Family       |
| Lion     | Panthera   | Leo      | Felidae      |
| GNU      | Connochaetes | Gnou     | Bovidae      |
| Gentoo Penguin | Pygoscelis   | Papua    | Spheniscidae   |
| Burr gherkin   | Cucumis  | Anguria  | Cucurbitaceae  |
----

You don't have to align the pipes (+|+) as above,
but it makes your +.feature+ file look nicer.
+Gherkin+ doesn't care about that,
only that the number of columns match.

Speaking of Scenario Outlines,
as seen in our previous entry,
these are very useful to specify many
cause-effect relations:

//.Scenario Outlines
[source,gherkin]
----
When I do <action>
Then I get a <result>

Examples:
  |    <action>     |      <result>      |
  | Drink coffee    | Be more alert  |
  | Take a cab      | Get there faster   |
  | Open the window | Ventilate the room |
----

== More specific attack vectors documentation

For every vulnerability found,
it is important to explain
how it was found and
how it can be reproduced.
In our previous article,
we did just that,
though more of the explanations
lie in the article than in the +.feature+ file.
This time we're going to enrich our +Gherkin+ sources
with more information.

Consider this page from our good old friend
link:http://itsecgames.blogspot.com.co/[bWAPP],
which simply gives us a cryptic message:

.A mysterious message
image::default-file.png["Page with mysterious message"]

No matter how dumb it might seem,
this is the first thing we need to document:
how the page, app or whaetever we're testing
works at the moment we tested it.
We might use a separate "Normal use case" scenario
as we did before.

=== Background

However, since in this case the use-case is so simple,
we can just plug that behaviour right into the +Background+.
This must also include, in detail,
everything needed to run the app.
Our target +bWAPP+ is a +PHP+ web server;
Maybe you're running it inside a
link:http://itsecgames.blogspot.com.co/2013/07/bee-box-hack-and-deface-bwapp.html[+bee-box+]
virtual machine?
Or did you set up the
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29[+LAMP+]
server yourself?
On what operating system?
All of this must be in the background,
in order to allow reproducibility.

I, for one, am running +bWAPP+ inside a
link:https://www.docker.com/[+Docker+]
container made by
link:https://hub.docker.com/r/raesene/bwapp/[+raesene+],
so let there be a record of that in our attack feature:

[source,gherkin]
----
  Background:
    Given I am running Manjaro GNU/Linux kernel 4.9.86
    And I am running bWAPP 2.2 in Docker container raesene/bwapp:
    """
    ubuntu 14.04 LTS, kernel=host(4.9), MySQL 5.5, Apache 2.4.7, PHP 5.5
    """
    Given a PHP site showing a message:
    """
    URL: bwapp/directory_traversal1.php?page=message.txt
    Message: Try to climb higher Spidy...
    Evidence: default-file.png
    """
----

Notice how all the versions of all programs used
are explicitly listed,
and also the +URL+ where the vulnerability was found.
We summarised the page's behaviour in a single line,
because in this case it was so simple,
but we also refer to an external file called +default-file.png+
which is just the screenshot above.

=== Dynamic detection and exploitation

Now, the cryptic message in the page
might be trying to tell us something.
``Spiders'' or link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler[``crawlers''] are software pieces
that try to systematically browse a website,
which is also consistent with the
``try to climb higher'' part.
However this page is already at the root of the server,
since the page is right after the address +http://localhost/+.
How higher can we climb then?

As it turns out, anywhere.
Not just higher, but also deeper,
in (almost) any direction.
The next hint is in the +URL+.
The page takes a +GET+ parameter
+page=message.txt+.
So the file +message.txt+ is a simple text file
that contains the words above,
and what the page does is display it.
What if we change it to another text file?
Remember that +HTML+ and +PHP+ files are also text files,
only that they get rendered in a particular way
when opened with a web browser.
Let us try the file from our last-attacked page,
whose +URL+ was +http://localhost/commandi.php/+.
That also lives in the server root,
so it should be displayed if we change +message.txt+
to +commandi.php+:

.Abusing the website
image::source.png["Screenshot of abused page"]

Notice two things here:
first, the +PHP+ code and text commentaries are shown.
Hence we could theoretically access the +PHP+ source of
any page in this server.
Second, the +HTML+ part is actually rendered in the browser,
which could lead to a
link:../xss-protection/[+XSS+]
or
link:https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)[+CSRF+]
attack.

But wait.
The server is not just ``floating'' in space:
it lives inside a +GNU/Linux+ machine.
And 'everything' in such an +OS+ is a file,
many of which are plain-text files.
One of them is of particular importance:
link:https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/understanding-etcpasswd-file-format/[+/etc/passwd+],
which stores information about users.
Let us try to display it in this page,
setting +page=/etc/passwd+:

.Listing users in the +bWAPP+ servers
image::passwd.png["Viewing the contents of a system file in the page"]

We can document that using +Gherkin+ data tables,
in a scenario of its own,
due to the importance of the finding:

.Documenting a particular exploitation
[source,gherkin]
----
  Scenario: Users record extraction
    When I change the page=message.txt parameter to page=/etc/passwd
    Then we retrieve the following user records:

    # Records extracted
    | username | pw? | UID | GID | info | home | shell |
    | root     | x | 0 | 0 | root | /root | /bin/bash |

    | gnats    | x | 41 | 41 | Gnats Bug-Reporting System (admin) | /var/lib/gnats | /usr/sbin/nologin |
----

Now we know how many users there are on the server,
and which of them have passwords set.
Those are stored in
link:https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/understanding-etcshadow-file/[+/etc/shadow+]
in the form of hashes,
which can be
link:../storing-password-safely[cracked if the passwords are weak].
However, the +shadow+ file,
unlike the +passwd+ file,
is protected:

.A failure
image::protected.png["foo bar"]

'Drat!' Well, we'll find a way around it,
sooner or later.
Now that we got the hang of it
we can try other files.
Since we always do the same:
change +page=message.txt+ to +page=desired-file.txt+
we can use a Scenario Outline for that,
using one column for what we give as input,
and the other for the result:

.Documenting many cases in one Outline
[source,gherkin]
----
  Scenario Outline: Dynamic detection and exploitation
    Given the message and the page=message.txt GET parameter in the URL
    When I change the GET parameter page=message.txt to another page=<path>
    Then I see the file <printed> in the page, if it is a text file:

    Examples:
      |        <path>        |             <printed>             | <evidence>    |
      | /etc/passwd      | User accounts info          | passwd.png    |
      | /etc/group       | User groups info                |               |
      | /etc/shadow      | Couldn't open       | protected.png |
      | /etc/hosts       | Hosts file        |     |
      | commandi.php         | PHP source code and rendered HTML | source.png  |
      | passwords/heroes.xml | Heroes' passwords and secrets     |     |
      | admin/settings.php   | No output, but file exists        |     |
----

It is only natural to make several tries,
some of which fail, some of which succeed.
All of them should be reported
in the most scientific spirit.

=== Static detection and possible fixes

Let us see why +passwd+ could be read
and +shadow+ couldn't.
From 'inside' the server let us say

----
$ ls -l /etc/{passwd,shadow}
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1012 Feb 15  2016 /etc/passwd
-rw-r----- 1 root shadow  559 Feb 15  2016 /etc/shadow
----

Notice that +passwd+ has three +r+'s:
one for the owner (the user +root+),
one for the the owner's group (again, just +root+)
and the final one is for everyone else.
However +shadow+ doesn't have that last +r+,
so it can only be read by +root+.

While we're at static detection of problems,
let us see what is wrong with that page
so we can try to fix it.
The source code for the page
simply takes the +GET+ parameter +page+,
and displays it.

.Adapted from bWAPP code. Some lines and brackets omitted for clarity.
[source,php]
----
223  $file = $_GET["page"];
233  show_file($file);
136  function show_file($file)
141    if(is_file($file))
144      $fp = fopen($file, "r") or die("Couldn't open $file.");
146      while(!feof($fp))
149        $line = fgets($fp,1024);
150        echo($line);
151        echo "<br />";
----

We can include this exact snippet,
numbers and all, between +docstrings+,
while discussing code exploration in our feature file.

Now the main problem with this is
that we can pass, as seen before,
any file as a +GET+ parameter
and it will be shown, i.e.,
that input should have been validated and cleaned
somewhere between lines +223+ and +233+ above.

To fix that, a good first step would be to clean
strings like +..+, +./+ and +../+,
which is what you would generally use to
``climb higher Spidy'':

[source,php]
----
if(strpos($data, "../") !== false || strpos($data, "..\\") !== false ||
   strpos($data, "/..") !== false || strpos($data, "\..") !== false ||
   strpos($data, ".") !== false)
        $directory_traversal_error = "Directory Traversal detected!";
----

This would block attackers who do not know
the file system hierarchy in the server,
but still allows us to give absolute paths
as the parameter.
An even better defence would be that
the user should not be allowed to display files
outside the current folder:

[source,php]
----
// Gives the current directory path
$real_base_path = realpath("");
// Gives the absolute path equal to user input
$real_user_path = realpath($user_path);
if(strpos($real_user_path, $real_base_path) === false)
  $directory_traversal_error = ""Directory Traversal detected!";
----

But this still allows us to display the
file with the heroes' passwords.
In fact, it would be better just not to
allow users to display files at their will.

Furthermore, files that are opened
should be closed and also,
notice how the file is read line by line
using the function +fgets+ with a fixed number of characters.
If fed an input file that exceeds this limit,
that could cause a buffer overflow or
other unexpected error.
In this particular case it would be better
to use the +PHP+ function +fgetss+,
which does not require a character limit
and also throws in +HTML+ and +PHP+ code stripping.

=== More details

So far, we've documented in +Gherkin+:

. the background where we're running the vulnerable app,
. the dynamic detection and exploitation phase,
with several examples and evidences,
. the important records we were able to extract from the app,
. the static detection part, with specific bad code snippets,
issues and suggestions.

To finish a proper +.feature+ file,
we're missing, well, the feature itself,
which is the vulnerability, or rather,
the finding and exploitation thereof.

Remember that we can document features and scenarios using 'descriptions'.
After the keywords +Feature+, +Scenario+, +Scenario Outline+ or +Example+
we can write anything we like,
as long as no line starts with a keyword
(including comments - you can't mix descriptions with comments,
I learned that the hard way).

It is usual to describe features with the format
+As <type of user>
I want to <do something>
In order to <get some result>+.
We can take advantage of such a structure to
document the 'Scenario' and 'Actor' of the vulnerability,
the 'Threat' and what records can be 'compromised'.
We can also use that space to document anything else
we consider to be globally important:

[source,gherkin]
----
Feature: Vulnerability FIN.S.0075 Local file inclusion
  From the bWAPP application
  From the A7 - Missing functional level access controls category
  In URL bwapp/directory_traversal_1.php
  As any user from Internet with acces to bWAPP
  I want to be able to see local files I'm not supposed to
  In order to gain access to system objects with sensitive content
  Due to missing functional level access controls
  Recommendation: restrict access to sensitive files (REQ.0176)
----

For anything else, use comments.
I will include details such as
the vulnerability code,
link:https://cwe.mitre.org/[+CWE+],
link:https://nvd.nist.gov/[+CVE+]
if present,
computed metrics such as
link:https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss[+CVSS+]
scores, etc
in comments (+#+) at the beggining of the file.
See the <<apx-feature,full feature>> below.

''''

And that is how we propose
using this language
to document attacks.
You may ask: why +Gherkin+
and not just plain text?
Because it is
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-oriented_programming_language[line-oriented]
and has a light structure,
we can define a template like the one discussed here,
and we can enforce following of the format
using the readily available
link:https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/tree/master/gherkin[parsers],
link:https://github.com/vsiakka/gherkin-lint[linters]
and
link:https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/[compilers]
for the language.
We still need to work further
on the template definition,
so stay tuned.
