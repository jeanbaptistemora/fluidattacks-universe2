= Deep Hacking

If we have learned anything so far
in our quest to understand how
link:../crash-course-machine-learning/[machine learning] (`ML`)
can be used to
link:../machine-learning-to-hack[detect vulnerabilities] in source code,
it's that what matters the most in this process
are the different representations of source code
which are later fed to the actual `ML` algorithms.
Especially, that these representations should include
both semantic and syntactic information about the code.

Also, that one `ML` technique seems particularly promising,
but hardly exploited, namely,
link:../crash-course-machine-learning/#artificial-neural-networks-and-deep-learning[deep learning].
Methods such as Recurrent Neural Networks (`RNN`),
Convolutional Neural Networks (`CNN`), and Deep Belief Networks (`DBN`)
have been succesful in image and natural language processing.

The aim of the project `SySeVR` is thus to apply
deep learning techniques to
the discovery of sofware vulnerabilities in source code,
considering not also the _form_ (syntax) which might induce a vulnerability,
but also the flow of data and control in the program.
They also tried to produce results as finely granular as possible,
i.e., tell us exactly at which line or function the flaw arises.
If that's not enough, they also promise to explain
the cause of false positives, if there are any.

When working with images and pattern recognition,
objects of interest have a natural representation as vectors,
which are suitable for machine learning algorithms.
In that case it is easy to propose where an object in the image might be:
just take smaller pieces of the image, and test their
inherent features such as texture and color
to determine if they are or not what we want to detect.

In order to translate this idea to code,
the authors can leverage well-known patterns in
previously identified vulnerabilites.
Simply patterns that might trigger dangerous situations, such as
the use of `malloc` and pointers in `C`,
link:../pars-orationis-secura/#specifying-the-targets[concatenating user input],
link:../stand-shoulders-giants/[importing flawed libraries], etc.
Anything that a regular
link:../replaced-machines/[static analysis tool]
might look for, likely with false positives, though.
They call these _Syntactic Vulnerability Candidates_ (`SyVC`).
These can be either a single token (`malloc`)
taken from the program's
link:../oracle-code/#databases-out-of-programs[Abstract Syntax Tree]
or a set of tokens (`memset(dataBuffer...`) or
a whole statement which involves one of
the mentioned danger situations.

In order to avoid those, the next logical step
is to use semantic information about the program,
i.e. how data and control flows in it in order to expand
our knowledge about what happens before and after
executing a particular line of code.
And where does this information lie?
As we know by know, this can be found in the
link:../exploit-code-graph/#combining-standard-code-representations[`Control Flow` and `Program Dependency` graphs].
Armed with these two graphs,
one can find the whole "influence zone" of a particular token or line,
with a technique they call _program slicing_.
Basically it means to take all nodes in the semantic graph representations
that are reachable from the token of interest, the `SyVC`.
In other words, all lines of code that are executed before and after
this particular token and are somehow altered if its value were to change.
They call this a "Semantic Vulnerability Candidate".
Usually if the `SyVC` is a whole function,
then the corresponding `SeVC` will include all functions called by it
and all the function that call it.

The next problem to be solved is:
Having already identified a piece of the program that might
contain a vulnerability as a `SeVC`,
how do we encode that as a vector or something
that can be understood by machine learning algorithms?
The approach chosen by the authors is to first
give generic names to all the functions and variables
(thus sort of _obfuscating_ it lightly),
then perform a lexical analysis on it
(i.e. breaking it up into symbols) and finally
representing that strings as a bag of words,
a procedure we have already referred to in past articles.
A fixed length must be chosen and vectors that don't fit
must be padded or truncated,
given that the used neural networks take
vectors of a fixed length.

All that remains is to train and test the neural networks.
One of the goals of `SySeVR` was
to be able to work with different types of networks.
Six (!) different types of networks were implemented in `Python`
with the link:http://www.deeplearning.net/software/theano/[Theano]` library:
`CNN`, `DBN`, and four types of `RNN`:
(Bidirectional) Long-short term memory (`(B)LSTM`) and
(Bidirectional) Gated Recurrent Unit (`(B)GRU`).
They validated their results against a vulnerability dataset made up of
link:https://nvd.nist.gov/[`NVD`] and
link:https://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=923127[`SARD],
labeled either as vulnerable or not,
ideally some with the corresponding diff and
the vulnerability type.

But which syntactic common places to look for?
Who will be the syntactic vulnerability candidates?
For this, they used standard static detection tools
such as link:https://www.checkmarx.com/[`Checkmarx`],
link:https://dwheeler.com/flawfinder/[`Flawfinder`] and
link:https://security.web.cern.ch/security/recommendations/en/codetools/rats.shtml[`RATS`].
From these results, they focused on four main vulnerability types,
out of the 126 different _kinds_ of vulnerabilities contained in the dataset:

* Insecure `API` usage, v.g. `malloc` without `free`.
* Array usage.
* Pointer usage
* Improper arithmetic expressions.

For this particular "experiment",
the graph code representations were obtained with the tool
link:http://mlsec.org/joern/[Joern] by Yamaguchi et al.,
a sister project of link:../anomaly-serial-killer-doll/[`Chucky`] of sorts.
The `SeVC` to vector encoding was performed with
link:https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html[`word2vec`].

The results of the experiment can be summarized as follows:

* `Bidirectional gated recurrent unit` appears to be the best fit
for this kind of problem, as long as the training data is good.
In general the effectiveness of deep neural networks is a open research problem.

* For any kind of neural network used, it is better to
tailor them to the specific kind of vulnerability that is sought,
rather than try to use a catch-all type of model.

* `SySeVR` results are way better than those of current, commercial,
well-established static detection tools such as mentioned `Checkmarx`.

`SySeVR` was able to identify 15 vulnerabilities new to `NVD`
in open source projects like `Thunderbird` and `Seamonkey`,
all of which were, as it should,
link:../vulnerability-disclosure/[responsibly disclosed].
Some of them got listed in `CVE`.
Others were silently patched by their manufacturers.
These are, of course, the most important product of this idea and
are summarized in the following table:

.New vulnerabilities found by `SySeVR`.

Thus, the idea of applying deep learning techniques
to vulnerability discovery in source
apparently does deliver the promised results.
However as mentioned earlier,
these are to be taken with a grain of salt,
until the results are peer reviewed and
cross-validated by the academic and security communities,
or, at least, by link:../../[us].
