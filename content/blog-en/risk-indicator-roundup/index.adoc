:description: A comparison of risk indicators used in quantitative finance. Most of them have been discussed earlier in the blog, such as VaR, tVaR and LEC. We also introduce the ALE, a compare them all giving their respective pros and cons. In the end, it is a matter of choice or we can just use them all.

= Risk indicator roundup

What is the best risk indicator?
Bottom line: there is no "best", only different approaches to the same thing.
Ultimately, it's up to you.
Here we will show the pros and cons of each
so you can make an informed decision
(about that which will guide your informed decisions,
if you allow the _inception_ reference).

== VaR

link:../para-bellum/[Recall] that Value at Risk (+VaR+)
measures the worst-case scenario in an uncertain return
by telling us beyond how much our losses
will most likely _not_ go,
up to a certain degree of confidence,
in a definite period of time.
Thus a daily 1% `VaR` of $10 million means
that the probability that you will lose more than
ten million is 1%, which is the same as saying
that you are 99% confident that the losses
will not exceed $10 million.

Pros:

* Gives a good idea of how much to save in order
  to avoid bankruptcy in most (95%) cases.

* It is a well established standard,
  used by most banks and a requirement
  as per international banking regulations.

Cons:

* Says nothing about what might happen beyond the threshold.

* In fact, being a single number, its expressiveness
  is rather narrow. It says nothing about what happens
  elsewhere with the distribution of returns.


== tVaR

While the +VaR+ gives a worst case with a certain confidence,
what if that confidence is broken, i.e.,
the `VaR` is breached? What can we expect?
That's precisely the answer the
_tail_ value at risk tries to answer.
By using the link:../great-expectations/[expected value]
of a link:../updating-belief/#mathematical-interlude[conditional probability],
it gives us, in a single number,
what would be expected in case that the dreaded worst case scenario occurs.

No better way to summarize both `VaR` and `tVaR` than
does this plot by link:http://www.nematrian.com/TailValueAtRisk[Nematrian]:

Pros:

* Prepares you for the worst of the worst

* Single number, easy to compare or monitor over time

Cons:

* Not too easy to compute (involves an integral).

* Can be overly pessimistic, thus
  impeding you from seeing the other side of the coin.

== ALE

OK, this is a new one. Not all that new, though.
Remember we discussed Return on Control (`ROC`)
to decide whether investing in a given defense is worth the hassle?

.Return on control
image::../monetizing-vulnerabilities/roc.png[Return on control]

The change in loss was obtained from two simulated scenarios:
one with the control and another without it.
Both were obtained by "averaging out", i.e.
finding the link:../great-expectations/[expected value] of
a simulated distribution for the loss.

The Annualized Loss Expectancy (+ALE+) is related to such a computation,
in that it is also obtained from a couple of expected, estimated values,
namely, the expected number of ocurrences of an event in a year
(the Annualized Rate of Occurrence, +ARO+),
and the expected loss for a single ocurrence
(Single Loss Expectancy, +SLE+).
Thus, total = reps x single.
Too many acronyms for not too much content:

.You don't want to ask Chandler about his Annual Net Usage Statitics!
image::wenus.png[Acronyms joke]

The +ARO+ can be estimated by link:../ask-expert/[experts].
Suppose that it is known that a data breach will most likely occurr
at least once in 10 years,
the +ARO+ for such an event is 1/10 = 0.1 events per year.
The +SLE+ is to be estimated by your own experts.
How much would such a breach cost you?
Say, $100 million. Then the loss expected in every one of
those years is 0.1x100 = 10 million.
However this rate will be fixed for each of the next ten years.
It is static and unlikely to be true,
since risks and threats change daily.

Pros:

* Simple computation.

* Single number, thus easy to compare.

Cons:

* You're stuck with the one year period.

* Not very "realistic".

== LEC

This is a decidely different one,
and one of our favorites at that.
The loss exceedance curve.
We have already discussed it at length
in our
link:../quantifying-risk[introduction to quantitative risk],
our general link:../monetizing-vulnerabilities[Monte Carlo simulation article],
and gave an implementation in link:../quantitative-python[Quantitative Python].
In a nutshell, it is a graph that tells you
the probability of lossing a given amount or more,
for any amount in a range.
It's like having all possible values-at-risk
for all confidence levels.
We believe the graph speaks for itself:

.Loss Exceedance Curve from link:https://www.howtomeasureanything.com/cybersecurity/[Hubbard et al.]
image::../monetizing-vulnerabilities/simple-lec.png[Loss Exceedance Curve]

Pros:

* All the information you could want about losses, in a single plot.

* Since it is a visual tool, that aids in considering
  a range of risk to take, especially when combined with
  residual risk and risk tolerance curves.

Cons:

* Harder to compare since it's not a single number.

* Harder to obtain, since it involves simulations.

''''

Overall, single number risk indicators (+ALE+, +VaR+ and +tVaR+) are good
for making quick comparisons and monitoring them over time.
In contrast, the +LEC+ might allow you to make a more fine-grained
decision regarding how much risk you are willing to take vs.
how much you would have to lose in many different scenarios,
all in a single chart.

For ease of use, we'd say +ALE+ is the winner.
However, we wouldn't expect its predictions to be the most accurate of the lot.
Also, its time period (year) might be too much for
the fast-paced market we currently live in.
If you have to choose one single-number indicator,
we would recommend to go for the +VaR+,
as do international banking regulations
(link:https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/baselii.asp[Basel II]),
since the +tVaR+ might be a tad too extreme.

In the end, it's your choice.
Or there might not be any choice to make at all:
who says you cannot use them all at once?
If well done, they should not be contradictory, but complimentary.
Find out all you can about your investment,
use all the tools at hand, and you might well be making
the best decision in terms of risk vs gain.
