a|At Integrates a project’s stakeholders
(developers, technicians, management, etc.) can interface
with +Fluid Attacks+ hackers.
Through Integrates, +Fluid Attacks+ communicates all identified security risks
to a client’s systems for prompt,
efficient and effective remediation by the client company.
It also provides the client company’s decision-makers
with real time information regarding their systems’ security
and +Fluid Attacks+ project progress.

2+a|== Easy and Fast Authentication

A client company’s user credentials are not stored.
Using Integrates, a client company can access information
provided by +Fluid Attacks+ through their corporate email accounts
from +Google+ or +Microsoft+.

a|image::main-menu.svg[Main Menu]
2+a|== Main Menu

Dashboard allows a client company direct access
to all their ongoing projects with +Fluid Attacks+.
A client company can review an up-to-the-minute work history
of each of their project's events.

2+a|== Project Indicators

Project Indicators inform a client company
about the current status of a project,
using information including:

* Number of identified security vulnerabilities.
* Current threat level vulnerabilities pose to a client company’s systems.
* Vulnerabilities that have been remediated.

a|image::indicators.svg[Ethical Hacking Indicators]

a|image::graphs.svg[Ethical Hacking Graphs]
2+a|== Project Status Graphs

In Project Status Graphs a client company can see
the current status of reported security vulnerabilities.
This allows a client company to:

* Prioritize security vulnerabilities by the threat level they pose
to a client company’s systems.

* Differentiate between real vulnerabilities,
simple security issues, and hygiene issues.

* See a project’s progress based on the number of vulnerabilities remediated,
in the process of being remediated,
or that are waiting to be remediated.

2+a|== View Real-Time Events

All events that inhibit the execution of the project
can be viewed in real time.
a|image::eventualities.svg[Events]

a|image::user-tracking.svg[Ethical Hacking User Tracking]
2+a|== User tracking

Tracks and displays all users who have accessed a particular project.

2+a|== User Administration

A user can grant or revoke access to other users using this module.
a|image::user-administration.svg[Ethical Hacking Administration Access]

a|image::technical-report.svg[Ethical Hacking Technical Report]
2+a|== Generate Technical Reports

Executive Reports are a summary version of the technical report
specifically written so that non-technical stakeholders
and decision-makers can understand a client company’s vulnerabilities,
the threats they pose, the steps taken to insure system security,
and to track progress toward an endpoint.

2+a|== Generate Executive Reports

This document provides summarized and organized information.
Thus, it may be useful for all the project's stakeholders.

a|image::executive-report.svg[Ethical Hacking Executive Report]

a|image::prioritize-remediation.svg[Ethical Hacking Remediation]
2+a|== Prioritize Remediation

Prioritizing remediation helps a client company
determine which vulnerabilities require immediate attention.
Security vulnerabilities are prioritized based on parameters including:

* *Age:* Time between the report of an identified vulnerability
and the repair by a client company’s technical team.

*  *Severity:* level of threat posed by a vulnerability
according to the +CVSS+ (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) standard.

* *Status:* *OPEN* (a current, active threat),
*CLOSED* (no longer an active threat),
*PARTIALLY CLOSED* (poses a lowered threat level).

* *Resolution options:* *ASSUMED* (client company assumes any security risks
stemming from inaction), *PENDING* (client company has not yet decided
on any further action), *REMEDIATE* (client company will resolve
the security risk posed by the vulnerability).

2+a|== View Vulnerabilities

View Vulnerabilities allows the client company to see vulnerabilities
and information on their current status,
including severity of the threat, type of threat posed,
and identification/report date.

a|image::vulnerabilities.png[Ethical Hacking Vulnerabilities]

a|image::vulnerability-description.png[Ethical Hacking Vulnerability Description]
2+a|== Vulnerability Description

The Vulnerability Description contains technical information
about each vulnerability.
Information includes their location,
security risks they pose, and recommendations on how to eliminate them.

2+a|== Request Verification / Treatment

Clients may request a revision ^1^ of a vulnerability
they have remediated and ask +Fluid Attacks+ for documentation ^2^
of their remediation or treatment.
For documentation purposes, a client has the following options:

* *Accepted:* The client assumes the risk
that implies not solving the security issue.
* *New:* The client still has not decided whether to assume
or to remediate the vulnerability.
* *In Progress:* The client will solve the security issue.
a|image::request-verification.png[Request Verification]

image::treatment.png[Ethical Hacking Treatment]

a|image::vulnerability-severity.png[Ethical Hacking Vulnerability Severity]
2+a|== Vulnerability Severity

Vulnerability Severity indicates the risk level
an identified vulnerability poses to a client company’s systems
using the international Common Vulnerability Scoring System (+CVSS+) standard.

2+a|== Vulnerability Evidence

In Vulnerability Evidence proof that a security vulnerability exists
is shown graphically and includes a descriptive explanation.

a|image::vulnerability-evidence.png[Ethical Hacking Vulnerability Evidence]

a|image::exploitation-animation.gif[Ethical Hacking Exploitation Animation]
2+a|== Exploitation Animation

In Exploitation-Animation you can see an animated representation
of the process used to exploit a vulnerability through +gif+.

2+a|== Exploit

Exploit shows the diagnostic script used to expose,
or exploit, a security vulnerability.
This same script can also be used to verify a client company’s solution
for a particular problem has been successful.

If the client company is licensed to use our product,
[button]#link:../asserts/[Asserts]#, they may reproduce a mock attack
that targets the vulnerability to determine independently
if they have eliminated the vulnerability.

a|image::vulnerability-exploitation.png[Ethical Hacking Exploitation]

a|image::timeline.png[Ethical Hacking Timeline]

2+a|== Vulnerability Timeline

The Vulnerability Timeline shows the evolution
of a particular vulnerability over time.
Using report dates and different closing cycles
it illustrates the effectiveness of the closing cycles
performed by the client company.

2+a|== Compromised Records

Compromised Records shows the client company
the information such as names, identifiers, balances, products, etc.
that would be vulnerable to a security breach in a real attack.
This information is revealed during the execution
of +Fluid Attacks+ security tests.

a|image::records.png[Compromised Records]

a|image::vulnerability-comments.png[Ethical Hacking Vulnerability Comments]

2+a|== Communication Exchange/Chat with Us

At times it is necessary for +Fluid Attacks+ and a client company
to exchange insights, discuss questions or concerns,
and to clarify information flowing both ways.
Chat with Us provides a private forum on which a client company
and +Fluid Attacks+ can post messages concerning any aspect
of a client company’s project.
+Fluid Attacks+ engineering team will post a reply within +4+ hours
between +8 a.m.+ and +5 p.m.+ (Eastern Time, +U.S.A.+).
To insure a client company receives timely communication,
a notification will also be sent via email
when a reply to a client message has been posted.

2+a|== Notifications via e-mail

Notifications are sent via e-mail to the project's stakeholders.
Some of them are:

* Weekly, regarding changes in vulnerabilities.
* When a user comments in a specific vulnerability.
* When a user reports that a vulnerability has been remediated.
* When a validation of the remediation of a vulnerability is made.
* When a vulnerability reaches a certain age
(+15+, +30+, +60+ days old ...) and has not been treated.
