|====

a|`Rules` is a set of security requirements
that allows you to parameterize a pentest
according to the risk appetite of your organization.
`Rules` allows you to determine what is tested and what is not,
and what is considered a vulnerability and what is not.
It is also the basis for determining how rigorous a pentest was,
based on tested and untested requirements.
The security requirements are independent of the type of technology being used
and are written as specific and understandable objectives.
They are the security demands that you agree to follow and comply with.
In our hacking services, we determine if these are met or not.
