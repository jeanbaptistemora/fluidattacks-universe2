= Writer's Guidelines

Our target audience is everyone with an interest in +IT+ security,
whether they have advanced technical knowledge or not.
We suggest to use as much non-technical English as possible.
It is always best to be clear, concise, and to-the-point.

== Topics

Check our link:../topics/[list of topics].

== Acceptance Criteria

=== 1. Title

The title of the article must grab the reader's attention.
*It must not exceed 35 characters*

. Make the topic something fun or interesting.
It can be in the form of a question.
+
*Examples:*

* Wanting the +Cookie+.
* Information Security, an expense or an investment?

. Absolutely no generic titles.
+
*Examples:*

* SQL Injection.
* XSS Vulnerability.

=== 2. Structure

The document must have a +LIX+ complexity *below 50*.
This guarantees that the document is easy to read.
All documents must have:

. An introduction that tells the reader
what your article is about and what they can expect.

. A body containing specific information (details)
that supports or elaborates on your introduction.

. A short conclusion that wraps up or restates
the important points from the introduction.

=== 3. Format

Documents will only be accepted in an +AsciiDoc+ format.
For more information check out our
link:../format/[format page], the
link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[+AsciiDoc+ guide],
or a link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[quick reference].

=== 4. Word limit

Documents have strict length limits:

. *For Posts:*
between +800+ and +1200+ words.

. *For pages (sites):*
Between +400+ and +1200+ words.

=== 5. Semantic Line Breaks

Documents must have Semantic Line Breaks
(link:http://sembr.org/[SLB]),
in order to facilitate editing and
keep an organized record of modifications
in our version control system (+Gitlab+).
To do this, we define the following rules:

. Minimum words before a SLB: +4+.
. Maximum number of characters before a SLB: +80+.
. A SLB *must* be added after a period (.).
. A SLB *can* be added after
link:https://emedia.rmit.edu.au/learninglab/content/common-linking-words-0[linking  words and connectors], depending on the context and
respecting the previous rules.

Exceptions to the rule are:

. Links.
. Source Code.

*Example:*

.SLB Example.

For more information regarding +SLB+ and their use,
you can check out the link:http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/[semantic linefeeds guide],
link:https://scott.mn/2014/02/21/semantic_linewrapping/[semantic line wrapping guide],
or the link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-recommended-practices/#one-sentence[+AsciiDoc+ documentation]

=== 6. Images

. All documents must include at least
one image related to the topic being presented.

. All documents covers must be from
link:https://unsplash.com/[unsplash].

. All documents must include at least one image
from link:https://unsplash.com/[unsplash] and
ideally another graphic reference (it can be from
link:https://unsplash.com/[unsplash] or any other webpage).

. Use free professional images from
link:https://unsplash.com/[unsplash].

. Images that are not yours
must include a reference.

. Include a description of the image.

=== 7. Source

Unless the language forces you to do otherwise,
the source code must comply with the following:

. Be in English (even the comments).
. Indent using +2+ spaces instead of tabs,
unless the language requires otherwise.
. Use the +brace style+ seen in
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#Variant:_Stroustrup[stroustrup]
(+no one liners+).
link:https://eslint.org/docs/rules/brace-style#stroustrup[Example].
. Lines must not exceed +80+ characters in length.
. Lines must not contain
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comment_(computer_programming)#Debugging[+debug+ comments]
left behind.
. Function definition must be separated by +1+ empty line,
unless the linter or the language requires otherwise.

Embedded code snippets must comply with the following:

. Be enumerated. To do so add the parameter +linenums+
to the +source+ block.
. Not have more than +8+ lines.
. No repeating a snippet that has already been used in the guide.
. Add the lines of code to the +post+ using a code block,
don’t use images.

*Example:*

.example.c
[source, C, linenums]
----
function cool(x) {
  /*Please use SHORT comments in english when necessary.
  You must explain your code in the document*/
  int y;
  y = x + 1;
  return y;
  //And remember, do NOT exceed 8 lines ;)
}
----

=== 8. Exploit Explanations

In the case of documents focused on exploitation,
once the procedure is explained,
we recommend including a short +gif+
showing the result of what was explained.
Add a description for the +gif+.

.Exploit description example.
image::exploitation.gif[gif]

=== 9. Not permitted

. Code snippets that are not your own.

. Technical explanations not relevant to security:
+
*Example:* Introduction to a programming language
without mentioning how to securely program in said language.
