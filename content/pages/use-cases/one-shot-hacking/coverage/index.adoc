= Coverage

Ethical hacking can be done to achieve specific, full or variable coverage.
Specific coverage refers to a system where its overall size can be assessed
(application fields, lines of code, open ports)
and you choose to cover only a specific percentage.
When you choose to cover the entire system, that is full coverage.
Variable coverage refers to a system
where its overall size cannot be assessed and a specific scope is predefined.
