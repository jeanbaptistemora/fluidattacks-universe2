= Hacking Techniques, Team, Duration and Cycles

Continuous hacking means automatic and manual testing with speed.
It is done through the ethical hacking of the apps,
the infrastructure, and the source code.
*Fluid Attacks* makes Zero-Day findings and does not report false positives.
The testing needs access to the *Git* repository
and the integration environment.
The selected system is attacked repeatedly to test all existing versions
by using various techniques such as *SAST*, *DAST*, *IAST* and *SCA*.
