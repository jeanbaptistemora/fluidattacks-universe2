:solution: At Fluid Attacks, we offer the Vulnerability Assessment solution with advanced scanning software and our ethical hackers’ ability to identify, classify, and prioritize the vulnerabilities in the organizations’ information systems. This process can provide fundamental insight into your company’s cybersecurity, indicating how well it is protected against potential threats. At the same time, this can be a preliminary security test for your projects and can be complemented by a penetration test which is more oriented towards exploiting vulnerabilities in order to better understand the risk they represent.

= Vulnerability Assesment

=== Understanding vulnerabilities

Our standard services include consulting and clarification by hackers
(via Integrates) so that you can understand vulnerabilities without additional
cost. We provide you with valuable preliminary knowledge allowing you to later
achieve the remediation of each of the vulnerabilities that we report.

=== Zero-day vulnerabilities

Our ethical hackers are proficient at finding zero-day vulnerabilities. These
are flaws in IT systems which others have not yet found and which do not have
an established remediation patch.

=== Up-to-date protection

As you probably know, threats are in constant evolution. Our Vulnerability
Assessment solution is capable of identifying new vulnerabilities which are
frequently introduced into the set of known vulnerabilities and provides you
with regular access to the findings so that you can keep your protection up to
date.
