sell other security products. You can rely on the independence and impartiality
of our reports. There are no conflicts of interest, as we do not fix reported
vulnerabilities.

After our security analysis, you can determine the severity of the
vulnerabilities and risks that your company runs should you choose not to make
the necessary modifications  to the controls of your systems and their
protection.

=== Full tracking

Through our Integrates platform, you can access general and specific data for
