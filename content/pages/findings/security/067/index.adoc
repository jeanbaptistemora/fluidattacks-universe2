= F067. Improper resource allocation

== Description

The system allocates unnecessary resources due to the use of improper
programming practices or inefficient algorithms.
Alternatively, the allocation can be controlled by an external source (e.g.
user input),
hence, requests that consume a humongous amount of resources are processed
without any restriction.
