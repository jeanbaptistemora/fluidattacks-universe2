= F102. Email uniqueness not properly verified

== Description

The system performs a partial check on the uniqueness of email addresses,
as it does not properly filter the "*+*" character.
As a result, "**user@exam.com**", "**user+1@exam.com**" and
"**user+100@exam.com**" are considered independent despite the fact that they
all represent the "**user@exam.com**" email account.
The same is true for the "**.**" character in Google email accounts.
This lack of validation could cause two independent accounts to be linked to
the same email address.
