= Before Entering

==== 1. I already applied in a job portal.

*Why haven't I been invited to the process?*

After you apply to a vacancy
listed on any of the portals we are registered in,
it takes from +1+ to +2+ days for us to identify potential candidates,
classify them, and send invitations via email.
If you apply and have not received an invitation
or other notification after 2 consecutive business days,
and you believe your profile fits the vacancy,
send us an email query at careers@autonomicmind.com.

==== 2. The test application won't allow me to exit Moodle. What should I do?

If you already finished the exam,
click the button located on the lower right side of the screen to exit.
If this doesn’t work, try restarting your machine.
Don’t worry, you have already sent the test
and there won’t be any data loss.

==== 3. I don't have a RUT. How can I complete the third party form?

On the link:http://www.dian.gov.co/contenidos/servicios/rut.html[+DIAN+ webpage]
you can find out how to get your +RUT+, or how to update it,
if you already have one.

==== 4. I don’t know what vacancy I applied for. How can I find out?

Ask us via email at careers@autonomicmind.com.

==== 5. If I already applied for a specific vacancy, can I apply again?

*Using the same application but for different vacancies?*

Yes. If it has not been more than six months,
you can send us an email at career@autonomicmind.com
telling us you want to apply for a different vacancy
using your original application.
If it has been more than six months since your last application
you cannot use your original application;
you must apply again starting at the beginning.

Yes. You can apply for as many vacancies as you believe you qualify for;
just send us an email via careers@autonomicmind.com
telling us which vacancies you want to apply for.

==== 7. What experience should I already have in order to apply for vacancies?

You don’t need to have any experience.
What is essential is the ability to do research,
solve issues, and be capable of teaching yourself.

==== 8. What do I need to know to apply for vacancies?

We look for talented people with great potential and flexibility.
It doesn’t matter what your career currently is
or if you haven’t graduated yet.
What matters is your ability to adapt and follow our philosophy and values.
It is preferable if you have experience with programming languages,
but it is not mandatory.
We value your ability to successfully address a problem,
more than your professional degrees.
Our selection process is designed to encourage you
to acquire knowledge yourself and then use it to problem-solve.

==== 9. Does the company offer on-the-job training?

At +Fluid Attacks+ we do not require work experience,
nor do we certify the knowledge you acquire while working with us.
We do not offer on-the-job training.
It is up to you to acquire the knowledge you may need
and have the ability and the capability to overcome technical challenges
and successfully complete the immersion stages.
We evaluate all your abilities, including the attitude,
perseverance, and productivity you exhibit during the selection process
since all of these are necessary for any role in our organization.

==== 10. The application test doesn’t work. What should I do?

Try executing the test as an administrator.
If the problem persists,
you should try accessing the test from a different computer.
If you still have problems send us an email via careers@autonomicmind.com.

==== 11. I didn’t receive the attached file for data analysis. How do I get it?

Try downloading the file from [inner]#link:../non-technical-challenges/hallazgos-open-data.tar.bz2[here]#.

==== 12. I ran out of time for the test. Can I get more time?

If you have a valid reason
(application lockouts, unexpected restarts, connection issues),
send us an email at careers@autonomicmind.com
explaining what happened
and we will tell you how to proceed.

==== 13. I couldn’t send my data analysis. What should I do?

If you believe you have a valid reason
for not meeting the data analysis deadline,
send us an email at careers@autonomicmind.com
telling us why you didn't meet it,
and ask for a new delivery date.

==== 14. What should I put in my portfolio?

You can find instructions and
advice for creating your portfolio [inner]#link:../portfolio/[here]#.

This field is not mandatory.
Do not fill it in if you don’t have a +VISA+.

==== 16. What should I do after I've finished the character test?

Once the character test is completed,
you will receive your test results within minutes.
While you wait, we suggest you go to the next stage
and begin the knowledge test.

==== 17. Do I have to take the polygraph test?

In most cases, this test is not mandatory during the selection process.
However, since our business is information security,
it may be necessary for you to take this test
depending on the position you are applying for.

==== 18. Do I have to take the Gallup test?

This test is only required in certain cases.
Please notify us via email when you reach this stage,
and we will tell you whether or not you need to take it.

==== 19. Does this process perform a risk analysis with my data?

Yes, in the stage before hiring,
confirmation is made on the central risk
concerning any of your candidate data.

==== 20. I haven’t notified my current employer that I am applying for a job

*with another company. Is the reverse references stage mandatory?*

Because this is an advanced stage in the selection process,
yes, it is mandatory.

==== 21. I’m very shy when presenting in public.

*Is it mandatory to do the audition?*

During the selection process this stage is optional.
However, if you work at +Fluid Attacks+,
we expect you to have excellent communication skills,
regardless of the position you are hired for.

==== 22. Is it mandatory to complete all of the stages in the process?

Not necessarily.

It depends on the vacancy you applied for and your selection process.
We will tell you how to proceed,
and as always, if you have any questions, contact us.

==== 23. What does offer validity time mean?

It is the length of time +Fluid Attacks+
will hold open a job offer made to a specific candidate.
If during this time the candidate does not respond
with explicit and written acceptance of the job offer,
the offer will become invalid.
Another candidate will then be offered the job.
This allows us to fill vacancies as soon as possible.

==== 24. If I do not accept the offer, what happens to my immersion process?

Your immersion process ends immediately.

+Fluid Attacks+ will remove access to all training systems
and notify you of the total work hours
to be put on your monthly time-worked invoice.
