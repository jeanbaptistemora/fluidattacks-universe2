The next step in the selection process
to become a part of the +Fluid Attacks+ team
is taking a test
that looks to quantify the 4 main strengths
that we look for in a candidate.
Our philosophy is based on
putting together a very talented team
in which ethics and
respect are a priority,
where we will work to better your strengths
instead of trying to correct your weaknesses.
