= Technical Challenges

Because this stage parallels the other stages of the process,
you can work on this at the same time you are completing previous stages.
The more progress you make on it now,
the greater the probability that you may be evaluated before other participants
who finish their work in a linear fashion.

This stage can also function as a kind of lifesaver for you.
If you have not yet graduated, perhaps have no previous work experience,
or maybe got a low score on the knowledge test,
but were able to successfully finish this stage, you have the most valuable
competence of all: The ability to learn new things on the fly and apply them to
solve real problems.
This, along with a good personality and strong
[button]#link:../../values[values]#, mean more to us and our customers than
anything else.

== 1. Philosophy

In this stage, we want you to demonstrate, through practical exercises,
your technical skills by solving problems similar to the ones you will face in
your work with +Fluid Attacks+.

The technical challenges are divided into
+vbd-hacking+, +ctf-hacking+, and +programming+.
With the first,
you demonstrate your skill to bypass security controls.
With the second,
you demonstrate your adaptation skill when it comes to problem-solving
in unknown environments.
With the third,
you demonstrate your proficiency and speed in understanding source code.

By solving challenges we:

. Promote the solution of unresolved challenges.

. Encourage self-directed and independent learning.

By uploading your solutions to +GitLab+, you will be able to:

. Use the +GitLab+ infrastructure to analyze
your efficiency and work quality as you adapt to the process.

. Familiarize yourself with the tools
(+Git+, +AsciiDoc+, +Python+, +Gherkin+, etc) and
concepts (automation, unit tests, continuous integration, +linting+, etc.) that
you will use in your daily work with +Fluid Attacks+.

. Allow the community and the team to view your results.

== 2. Objectives

. Solve +3+ unique +programming+ challenges.

. Solve +3+ unique +ctf-hacking+ challenges.

. Solve +3+ unique +vbd-hacking+ challenges.

== 3. Recommendations

. When solving +programming+ challenges,
we recommend [button]#link:https://www.codeabbey.com/[Codeabbey]#.
Also, we suggest using a language that is not widely used.

. When solving +ctf-hacking+ challenges,
we recommend [button]#link:https://www.root-me.org/?lang=en[Root Me]#.

. After solving a challenge, immediately submit your answer.
Do not save your answers to send later as a larger group submission.
When you send them individually and immediately you will receive feedback
that will tell you what,
if anything, you did incorrectly and may help you with upcoming questions.

== 4. Stage steps

To successfully finish this stage, you must:

. Register on +GitLab+ using your personal email
and the username of your choice.
Your username must not exceed *12* characters in length
and only contain lowercase letters and numbers.

. Join our link:https://join.slack.com/t/autonomicmind/shared_invite/enQtMzU0MDc3NzQwNzI2LTQ1NTZmMDFhZjJmZDQ0ZGRmN2M5MGQ3N2JhYjg0ZTI4OWFkZGJmMjdkYzBjYmU2ZDM1NGI0MmM4OGQxOWVlNDc[Slack channel],
where you can interact with +Fluid Attacks+ personnel and other candidates,
who are working in the same stage that you are,
to discuss questions or issues you may have.

. Request permission to access the +Git Training+ repository by filling out this
[button]#link:https://fluidattacks.com/forms/access[form]#.

. In the +Repo Access Message+ field, paste the following message:
+
[quote]
____________________________________________________________________
I have read and understood all documentation pertaining to technical challenges,
I agree to all of the terms and
therefore request access to the +git+ +training+ repository
with my +GitLab+ username.
____________________________________________________________________

. Complete +three (3)+ +programming+ challenges

. Complete +three (3)+ +ctf-hacking+ challenges

. Request permission to access the +Writeups+ repository by filling out this
[button]#link:https://fluidattacks.com/forms/access[form]#.
This time around, the Repo Access Message field should have the following:
Request developer permissions to the +Writeups+ repository through this
.

. Complete +three (3)+ +vbd-hacking+ challenges in the writeups repository.

== 5. Conditions

The challenge stage ends under any of the following conditions:

. You have met all link:#objectives[objectives] and
sent an +email+ with the links to your solutions in the +master+ branch.
. If there has been no activity
(+push+ to the +git+ repos) within 14 calendar days.
. If you clearly state,
via email,
that you are no longer interested in continuing the process.
. If you present someone else’s complete or
partial solutions as your own (plagiarism).
. If you solve a challenge with the help of others.

In all cases, the email address for these steps is: careers@autonomicmind.com

If you were removed from the process due to any of these circumstances,
except for the last two,
You may apply again at any time
and start over the process by clicking

* You can tell us your doubts and
questions in our *#general*

== 8. Plagirism

Having the solutions available at everyones disposal
poses an opportunity for plagiarism,
How do we show the solutions to the world and avoid plagiarism?
Plagiarism is not a technical problem,
It is a moral problem of presenting someone else’s work
as your own.

To avoid plagiarism we seek visibility and
an explicit declaration of the authorship of each algorithm
in a centralized place.
This provides clear evidence of the attribution of authorship and
allows for public scrutiny in case of plagiarism.

In other words, the current model avoids plagiarism
through total transparency.

+Fluid Attacks+ actively applies algorithmic similarity detection techniques
on all solutions submitted.
In particular using:
