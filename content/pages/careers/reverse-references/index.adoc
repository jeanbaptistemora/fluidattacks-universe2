= References

In this stage of the process,
we validate the references
from your previous employer.
Two of your direct bosses (your boss's superior and your family do not apply)
from the previous jobs you listed in our application
must call at the number given below.

This is all about doing everything needed
to get two of your bosses to give us a call
in order to have a short conversation with them
regarding your performance
so that we can get an idea of
how you worked in said companies.

* Cellphone: *+57 320 788 1879*

Please send us an email
confirming the names and contact information
of the two bosses that are going to call us.

Don't hesitate to contact us
if you have any doubts regarding the process.

The person that will contact you is Juan Restrepo.
