There is an explicit policy for how cryptographic keys (if any) are managed,
and the lifecycle of cryptographic keys is enforced.
Ideally, follow a key management standard such as +NIST SP 800-57+.

Verify that there is an explicit policy
for how cryptographic keys are managed
(e.g., generated, distributed, revoked, and expired).
Verify that this key lifecycle is properly enforced.

Verify that all consumers of cryptographic services
do not have direct access to key material.
Isolate cryptographic processes, including master secrets
and consider the use of a virtualized or physical hardware key vault (HSM).
