= R031. Discard user session data

== Requirement

When a session is terminated, either manually or automatically,
the system must discard all related data and the session tokens must lose their
validity.

== Description

Session tokens have associated permissions that allow any actor who possesses
them to perform actions in a system.
If session tokens are not removed from the client-side storage nor from the
server,
it increases the chances that they will be compromised.
Furthermore, if they are not invalidated once a session is closed,
the time during which a compromised session can be used maliciously is
increased.
