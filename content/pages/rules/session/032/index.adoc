= R032. Avoid session ID leakages

== Requirement

The system must not expose session IDs in URLs
and messages presented to the user.

== Description

Session IDs are sensitive information that may allow an attacker to steal,
modify and/or destroy information once they get one.
Information sent via URL parameters is:

* stored in clear text in the browser history.
* sent to external sites via the referrer HTTP header.
* sent to external sites via the search bar if the browser interprets the
URL as query.
* visible to scripts running on the browser that may belong to
third-parties.

Therefore, session IDs should neither be sent via URL parameters,
nor displayed as messages presented to the user nor stored in logs.
