= R189. Specify the purpose of data collection

== Requirement

The system must specify the purpose of personal data collection
(**OECD.9**, **ISACA.G31.3.**),
and it must do so before requesting the user's consent for the collection.


== Description

Applications usually request or collect personal data from their users.
Such collection must be properly justified according to the legal requirements
of each nation.
These reasons must be accessible for the user in a clear manner, in an easy
to understand language and before requesting their consent for the collection
and processing of data.
