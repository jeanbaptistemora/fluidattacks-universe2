= REQ.310 Request user consent

== Requirement

The system must request the user's consent whenever it collects any information
about them or their actions.

== Description

Systems usually request information from the users or collect it based
on their interactions with the application.
Regulations demand that none of these collections occur without the user's
consent and that this consent be demonstrable afterwards.
Therefore, consent must always be requested in a clear manner and using an easy
to understand language.

Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to
demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of his or her
personal data.
