= REQ.312 Allow user consent revocation

== Requirement

The system must enable the users to revoke whatever consent they have granted.

== Description

Systems usually request information from the users or collect it based
on their interactions with the application.
Regulations demand that none of these collections occur without the user's
consent and that this consent be demonstrable afterwards.
Regulations also demand that the user be allowed to revoke,
at any given time,
whatever consent they may have granted regarding the collection of their
information.
