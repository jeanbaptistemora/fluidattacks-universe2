= R313. Inform inability to identify users

== Requirement

The system must inform the users whenever it can demonstrate its inability to
individually identify them using the information it has collected from them.

== Description

Systems usually request information from the users or collect it based
on their interactions with the application.
Some regulations related to the collection of personal data are only applicable
if the user can be identified using this data.
Whenever the system is unable to individually identify its users with the data
it collects from them,
and it can demonstrate it,
it must inform them of this situation.
