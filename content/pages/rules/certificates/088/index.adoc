= R088. Request client certificates

== Requirement

Systems that manage business-critical information must require digital
certificates from the client.
This must be done especially during the authentication process.

. [[r1]] link:https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/299.html[CWE-299: Improper Check for Certificate Revocation].
The software does not check or incorrectly checks the revocation status of a
certificate,
which may cause it to use a certificate that has been compromised.

. [[r2]] link:https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/521.html[CWE-521: Weak Password Requirements].
The product does not require that users should have strong passwords,
which makes it easier for attackers to compromise user accounts.

A verifier impersonation-resistant authentication protocol SHALL establish an
authenticated protected channel with the verifier.
It SHALL then strongly and irreversibly bind a channel identifier that was
negotiated in establishing the authenticated protected channel to the
authenticator output
(e.g., by signing the two values together using a private key controlled by the
claimant for which the public key is known to the verifier).

Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other usersâ€™ identities
temporarily or permanently.
