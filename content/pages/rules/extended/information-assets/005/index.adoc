= REQ.005 Monetary Value of Assets is Defined

== Name

All information assets must be valued in monetary terms

== Description

The organization must value all previously identified assets
in monetary terms,
keeping in mind the value it represents to the business.
This will allow the organization
to know the importance of assets
as well as the cost of loss
and also allow them to determine and establish cost effective controls.

== Implementation

Defining the value of the information assets
is a complex topic due to the fact
that information assets are intangible.
Intangible information assets include
but are not limited to:

* Knowledge.
* Relations.
* Corporate secrets.
* Licenses.
* Patents.
* Experience.
* Technical knowledge.
* Corporate image.
* Brand.
* Comercial reputation.
* Client's trust.
* Competitive advantage.
* Ethics.
* Productivity.

Initially in immature asset management processes,
an organization may choose to define a qualitative value for their assets
according to a previously defined classification criteria,
however, as the organization betters their processes
It is strongly recommended that the organization
uses a monetary model to value their information assets.

To establish the value of an asset
the following items should be taken into account:

* The commercial value of the information.

* The cost of reposition in case of loss.

* The cost of the business impact in case of loss.

* The value of the preservation of the information.

With these variables in mind
the organization can define a formula
to establish the monetary value of their assets.
