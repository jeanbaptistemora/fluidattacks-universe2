must be defined.

== Description

There must exist a list of system components to be tested
during the different stages of the development life cycle.

== Implementation

. Once the system components have been identified,
the testing plan for those mentioned above must be established
in order to ensure the control of the possible existing vulnerabilities.
The list of components to be tested must be delivered
during the execution of each testing stage.

== Attacks

. A system component remains untested
because it was not identified during the testing stage
and it is exploited in the production stage.

== Attributes
