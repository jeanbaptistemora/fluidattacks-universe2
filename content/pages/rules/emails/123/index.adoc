= R123. Restrict reading of emails

== Requirement

The system must guarantee that exposed email addresses can only be viewed by
humans.

== Description

Sometimes, corporate email addresses are exposed on the company's website or
another overly public medium.
These emails should only be visible to human beings,
which can be accomplished by, for instance, publishing them as images instead
of as plain text.
This prevents automatic tools from collecting them and adding them to bulk
email distribution lists.
