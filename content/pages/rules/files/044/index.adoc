V5.3 Output encoding and Injection Prevention Requirements.(5.3.1)]
Verify that output encoding is relevant for the interpreter and context
required.
For example, use encoders specifically for *HTML* values, *HTML* attributes,
JavaScript, URL Parameters, *HTTP* headers, *SMTP*, and others as the context
requires, especially from untrusted inputs
(e.g. names with Unicode or apostrophes, such as ねこ or O'Hara).
