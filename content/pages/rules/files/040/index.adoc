== References

. [[r1]] link:https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/646.html[CWE-646: Reliance on File Name or Extension of Externally-Supplied File].
The software allows a file to be uploaded,
but it relies on the file name or extension of the file to determine the
appropriate behaviors.
This could be used by attackers to cause the file to be misclassified and
processed in a dangerous fashion.
