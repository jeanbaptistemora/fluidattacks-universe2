= R183. Delete sensitive data securely

== Requirement

The system must support the secure removal of sensitive data
when they are no longer required,
so that they can not be recovered.

== Description

Systems often store and delete sensitive information protected by government
regulations.
These regulations usually demand that data be removed after it is no longer
required and that its deletion follow secure procedures that prevent it
from being recovered.
