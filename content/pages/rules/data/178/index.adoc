= REQ.178 Use digital signatures

== Requirement

The system must use digital signatures
to ensure the authenticity of sensitive information.

== Description

A digital signature is a cryptographic mechanism that helps identify the sender
of a message, and guarantee its authenticity and integrity.
It should be used when dealing with very sensitive information or with
data and resources that are susceptible to being affected by third parties.

The software does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data,
in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

The software does not verify, or incorrectly verifies,
the cryptographic signature for data.

The product downloads source code or an executable from a remote location and
executes the code without sufficiently verifying the origin and integrity of
the code.

Verify that if the application has a client or server auto-update feature,
updates should be obtained over secure channels and digitally signed.
The update code must validate the digital signature of the update before
installing or executing the update.
