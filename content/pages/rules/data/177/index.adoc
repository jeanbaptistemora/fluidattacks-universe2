= REQ.177 Store data securely

== Requirement

The system must not store sensitive information
in temporary files or cache memory.

== Description

Applications sometimes reside in or get consumed by environments in which
caching is possible.
Caching helps performance or makes certain actions more comfortable for the
application users.
However, cached information is often more susceptible to being exposed or
corrupted.
Thus, avoiding cache memory and temporary files helps protect sensitive
information.
