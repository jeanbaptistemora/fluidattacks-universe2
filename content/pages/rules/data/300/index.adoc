= REQ.300 Mask sensitive data

== Requirement

Bussiness sensitive data
(credit card numbers, *CVV*, etc) must be masked.

== Description

Applications usually handle personal information such as credit card numbers,
*CVV*, personal identifications, social security numbers, etc.
The exposure of this data could severely affect their owners and so they must
be considered sensitive and specifically protected.
Masking is a mechanism that contributes to this protection.

Personal data which are, by their nature, particularly sensitive in relation
to fundamental rights and freedoms merit specific protection as the context of
their processing could create significant risks to the fundamental rights
and freedoms.
