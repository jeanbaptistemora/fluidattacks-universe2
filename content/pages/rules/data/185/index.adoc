= R185. Encrypt sensitive information

== Requirement

All stored sensitive information must be encrypted.

== Description

Systems usually store personal data, credentials and other types of sensitive
information.
All of these must be encrypted before being stored using safe cryptographic
mechanisms.
Doing so prevents unauthorized actors that may have accessed the storage system
from obtaining the information.
