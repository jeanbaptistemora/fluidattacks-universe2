= R180. Use mock data

== Requirement

Environments other than production should use mock or automatically-generated
data.

== Description

Applications usually handle personal and other types of sensitive information.
This information should not be used to perform tests or during development
processes,
as it could lead to unintended exposure.
Non-production environments should use mock data or data that has been
automatically generated.

Personal data which are, by their nature, particularly sensitive in relation to
fundamental rights and freedoms merit specific protection as the context of
their processing could create significant risks to the fundamental rights and
freedoms.

Many web applications and **API**s do not properly protect sensitive data,
such as financial, healthcare, and *PII*.
Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit card
fraud, identity theft, or other crimes.
Sensitive data may be compromised without extra protection,
such as encryption at rest or in transit, and requires special precautions when
exchanged with the browser.
