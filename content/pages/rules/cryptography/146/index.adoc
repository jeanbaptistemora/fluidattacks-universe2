Verify that there is an explicit policy
for how cryptographic keys are managed
(e.g., generated, distributed, revoked, and expired).
Verify that this key lifecycle is properly enforced.

Verify that sensitive passwords or key material maintained in memory
is overwritten with zeros as soon as it no longer required,
to mitigate memory dumping attacks.

Verify that there is an explicit policy for management of cryptographic keys
and that a cryptographic key lifecycle follows a key management standard such
as **NIST SP 800-57**.
