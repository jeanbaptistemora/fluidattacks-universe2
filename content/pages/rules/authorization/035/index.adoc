= R035. Manage privilege modifications

== Requirement

The system must not allow system actors to modify privileges for themselves.

== Description

Systems should usually have a set of roles with different levels of
privilege for accessing resources.
The privileges of each role must be clearly defined and the role of each user
should also be clearly stated.
Furthermore, users should not be allowed to modify their own privileges,
as this could be leveraged to access otherwise restricted functionalities and
resources.

A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform
unsafe actions that were not intended,
even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

. [[r2]] link:https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/269.html[CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management]
The software does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for
an actor,
creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

V4.1 General Access Control Design.(4.2.3)]
Verify that the principle of least privilege exists - users should only be able
to access functions, data files, URLs, controllers, services, and other
resources, for which they possess specific authorization.
This implies protection against spoofing and elevation of privilege.
