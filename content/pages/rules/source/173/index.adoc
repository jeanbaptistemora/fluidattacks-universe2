= R173. Discard unsafe inputs

== Requirement

The system must discard all potentially harmful information
received via data inputs.

== Description

Technological devices and, in particular, applications
must be able to notice if the received information
that does not correspond to its operational purposes,
in order to treat it properly
(for example, rejecting and/or generating timely alerts)
and so that it does not impact the operation negatively.
Typical examples of this are: *SQL* queries, *JavaScript* code,
*OS* commands or *LDAP* queries
in fields and application parameters;
text with undesired special characters
and their possible combinations in fields and parameters;
files manipulated in structure and extension
to be loaded in an application or technology artifact,
and in general any type of information
that does not correspond to the requested format.
A large amount of the incoming traffic
(which does not correspond to operational purposes)
of a technological artifact must also be considered
and controls and proper treatment must be applied.

== Implementation

. Perform whitelisting instead of blacklisting:
By using this principle, the control implementation
will be configured to reject all inputs
that are not explicitly approved
discarding all possible scenarios
and forcing enumeration of strictly allowed inputs.
E.g. allow only *a-z*, *A-Z* y *0-9*.

. Use variable highlight:
If supported, language and compiler
can detect foreign variables
that are not validated by a filter.
To this end, you may use techniques to highlight those variables
and compilers or pre-processors
to detect that they are not validated.

. No only user validation but also input validation:
Any input from outside the application
must be considered malicious,
that is to say, the user can enter incorrect information
as well as potentially harmful inputs
that may also compromise external systems,
therefore this information must be validated.

== Attacks

. Inject malicious software or code.
. Denial of service caused by register overload.
. Cross-Site Scripting (*XSS*).
. *OS* command injection.
. *SQL* injection.
. *LDAP* injection.
. Redirect to untrusted pages.

Injection flaws, such as **SQL**, **NoSQL**, **OS**, and *LDAP* injection,
occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or
query.
The attacker's hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended
commands or accessing data without proper authorization.

Many older or poorly configured *XML* processors evaluate external entity
references within *XML* documents.
External entities can be used to disclose internal files using the file *URI*

*XSS* flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web
page without proper validation or escaping,
or updates an existing web page with user-supplied data using a browser *API*
that can create *HTML* or **JavaScript**.
*XSS* allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim's browser which can
hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious
sites.

they can be used to perform attacks,
including replay attacks, injection attacks, and privilege escalation attacks.
