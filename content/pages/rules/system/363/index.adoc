= R363. Synchronize system clocks

== Requirement

Critical systems must have synchronized clocks whose configuration is protected
and comes from industry-accepted sources.

== Description

Systems must properly record exceptional and security events in protected logs.
This allows administrators to find bugs and makes it easier for forensics teams
to determine how a system was compromised.
However, if clocks are not properly synchronized,
it can be very difficult to compare log files from different systems in order
to establish the event sequence that led the security incident.
