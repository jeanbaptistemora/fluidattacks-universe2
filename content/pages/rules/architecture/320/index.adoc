= R320. Avoid client-side control enforcement

== Requirement

The system must enforce access controls on trusted enforcement points,
not on the client's side.

== Description

Systems must enforce access controls on trusted enforcement points such as
access control gateways, severs and serverless functions.
Client-side access control enforcement can not be trusted because it is prone
to being bypassed and/or tampered with.
