= REQ.320 Avoid client-side control enforcement

== Requirement

The system must enforce access controls on trusted enforcement points,
not on the client's side.

== Description

Systems must enforce access controls on trusted enforcement points such as
access control gateways, severs and serverless functions.
Client-side access control enforcement can not be trusted because it is prone
to being bypassed and/or tampered with.

The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource
from an unauthorized actor.

The software is composed of a server that relies on the client to implement a
mechanism that is intended to protect the server.

V1.4 Access Control Architectural Requirements.(1.4.1)]
Verify that trusted enforcement points such as at access control gateways,
servers, and serverless functions enforce access controls.
Never enforce access controls on the client.

V1.4 Access Control Architectural Requirements.(1.4.4)]
Verify the application uses a single and well-vetted access control mechanism
for accessing protected data and resources.
All requests must pass through this single mechanism to avoid copy and paste or
insecure alternative paths.
