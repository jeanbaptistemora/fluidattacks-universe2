= R320. Avoid client-side control enforcement

== Requirement

The system must enforce access controls on trusted enforcement points,
not on the client's side.

== Description

Systems must enforce access controls on trusted enforcement points such as
access control gateways, severs and serverless functions.
Client-side access control enforcement can not be trusted because it is prone
to being bypassed and/or tampered with.

Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users’ identities
temporarily or permanently.

Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not
properly enforced.
Attackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionality and/or
data, such as access other users’ accounts, view sensitive files,
modify other users’ data, change access rights, etc.
