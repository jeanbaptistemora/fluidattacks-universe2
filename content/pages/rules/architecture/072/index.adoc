= R072. Set maximum response time

== Requirement

The response time with the maximum expected concurrence
must be no more than 5 seconds.

Response time is a relevant measure of a system's availability and
adaptability to stress.
It is also important when it comes to usability and reliance.
For these reasons the response time must not surpass 5 seconds when the
number of concurrent users reaches its peak.
