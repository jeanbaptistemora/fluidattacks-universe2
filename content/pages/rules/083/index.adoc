= REQ.083 Avoid sensitive data logging

== Requirement

System must not register sensitive information
in logs exceptional events.

== Description

While event logging is generally a good security practice,
organization must consider that using high logging levels
is only appropriate for development environments,
since having too much log information in production stages
may hinder the performance of a system administrator
to detect abnormal conditions.
This may imply that both attacker and attack
can remain hidden while trying to penetrate the system,
reduce the audit trail in a forensic analysis,
or difficult the debugging of issues in production environments.

== Implementation

. Delete big volumes of records in duplicated logs
and replace them with periodic summary messages.
For example, +syslog+ may register a repetition event
saying "the last message was repeated +X+ times",
to avoid multiple logging of the same event.

. Set a maximum size for log files.
If the maximum size is reached,
the system administrator must be notified.
You may also consider to reduce subsystem functionalities.
This may cause a denial of service for all users,
but prevent subsystems from negatively impact the overall system.

. Properly adjust system settings
when changing from debugging to production stage.

== Attacks

. The system may suffer in terms of performance when log files
become excessively large and consume excessive resources.

. By storing too much information in logs it loses its value
in case of performing a troubleshoot diagnosis to recover from an attack
or a forensic analysis.

. If administrators are not able to effectively process files in logs,
attack attempts may remain unnoticed,
which eventually will compromise the system security.

Verify that the application does not log sensitive data
as defined under local privacy laws or regulations,
organizational sensitive data as defined by a risk assessment,
or sensitive authentication data that could assist an attacker,
including userâ€™s session identifiers, passwords, hashes, or +API+ tokens.
