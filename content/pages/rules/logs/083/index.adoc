= REQ.083 Avoid logging sensitive data

== Requirement

The system must not register sensitive information
when logging exceptional events.

== Description

While event logging is generally a good security practice,
the organization must consider that using high logging levels
is only appropriate for development environments,
since having too much log information in production stages
may hinder the performance of a system administrator
to detect abnormal conditions.
Furthermore, if sensitive information is recorded in the logs,
an attacker that gets access to these can also obtain the information.

== Attacks

. If an attacker gets access to the logs,
he might be able to compromise other systems using the sensitive information.

== Attributes

* Layer: Application Layer
* Asset: Logs
* Scope: Confidentiality
* Phase: Operation
* Type of Control: Procedure

Information written to log files can be of a sensitive nature and give valuable
guidance to an attacker or expose sensitive user information.

Verify that the application does not log sensitive data
as defined under local privacy laws or regulations,
organizational sensitive data as defined by a risk assessment,
or sensitive authentication data that could assist an attacker,
including userâ€™s session identifiers, passwords, hashes, or *API* tokens.

Verify that a common logging format and approach is used across the system.
