= REQ.075 Record exceptional events in logs

== Requirement

The system must register all exceptional and security events in logs.

== Description

The organization must properly record the exceptional and security events
in duly protected logs (confidentiality),
considering that an event of this type
should not show confidential or detailed information of the problem
in error messages to prevent the use of that information
on the part of an attacker or malicious user.

Recorded events allow error pages to display simple generic messages,
alerting end users that an error has occurred,
with some option to contact support.

The detail of how to address these problems
should be kept securely stored in a previously defined log storage.
When an event of these types is not properly recorded,
a malicious behavior can be proven difficult to detect
or a forensic analysis can be obstructed
in case an attack is successful.

== Implementation

. Use a centralized logging mechanism
that supports several levels of detail.
Make sure all events
related to successes and failures are recorded.

. Make sure that the logging level
is properly configured for production environments.
Enough information must be recorded
to allow a system administrator to detect attacks,
diagnose errors and recover from attacks.
On the other hand, recording too much information
can lead to the same problems (**CWE-779**).

== Attacks

Given the scenario that critical security information is not recorded,
an attacker can perform an attack
that won't leave a trace during a forensic analysis,
therefore discovering the cause of the problem
or the origin of one or several attacks
can prove to be very difficult or impossible.
