= R079. Record exact occurrence time of events

== Requirement

The system must log the exact occurrence time
(date, hour, seconds, milliseconds and time zone)
for each exceptional and security event.

== Description

Event logs must contain the exact time of occurrence
in order to allow backtracking in an investigation.

== Implementation

. Once all the events to be logged are defined,
the system must be configured so that these logs
contain the date, hour, seconds, milliseconds and time zone
of the event occurrence.

== Attacks

In a security incident scenario,
event time and duration cannot be clearly identified
due to the lack of detail in log records.

== Attributes

* Layer: Application Layer
* Asset: Logs
* Scope: Responsibility
* Phase: Operation
* Type of Control: Procedure

When a security-critical event occurs,
the software either does not record the event or omits important details about
the event when logging it.

Verify that each log event includes necessary information
that would allow for a detailed investigation
of the timeline when an event happens.

Time sources should be synchronized to ensure logs have the correct time.
