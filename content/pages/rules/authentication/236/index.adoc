V3.6 Re-authentication from a Federation or Assertion.(3.6.1)]
Verify that relying parties specify the maximum authentication time to **CSP**s
and that **CSP**s re-authenticate the subscriber if they haven't used a session
within that period.

Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other usersâ€™ identities
temporarily or permanently.
