. [[r1]] link:https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/645.html[CWE-645: Overly Restrictive Account Lockout Mechanism]
The software contains an account lockout protection mechanism,
but the mechanism is too restrictive and can be triggered too easily,
which allows attackers to deny service to legitimate users by causing their
accounts to be locked out.

Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other usersâ€™ identities
temporarily or permanently.

Verify that anti-automation is in place
to prevent breached credential testing, brute forcing,
and account lockout attacks.
