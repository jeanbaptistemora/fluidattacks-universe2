= R328. Request MFA for critical systems

== Requirement

Access to critical systems must be protected by a multi-factor
authentication (*MFA*) mechanism.

== Description

Single-factor authentication mechanisms often offer poor security due to
the weak, common or easy-to-guess passwords that users tend to set.
There also exist several applications and sets of data whose sole purpose
is breaking into systems protected by single-factor authentication.
Therefore, critical systems should not rely only on it but take advantage of
the protection offered by multi-factor authentication (*MFA*).

When an actor claims to have a given identity,
the software does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

The software implements an authentication technique,
but it skips a step that weakens the technique.

The use of single-factor authentication can lead to unnecessary risk of
compromise when compared with the benefits of a dual-factor authentication
scheme.

A protection mechanism relies exclusively, or to a large extent, on the
evaluation of a single condition or the integrity of a single object or entity
in order to make a decision about granting access to restricted resources or
functionality.
