The use of single-factor authentication can lead to unnecessary risk of
compromise when compared with the benefits of a dual-factor authentication
scheme.

Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other usersâ€™ identities
temporarily or permanently.
