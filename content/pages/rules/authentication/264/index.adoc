= R264. Request authentication

== Requirement

The system must require authentication for all resources,
except for the consultation or visualization
of those specifically classified as public.

== Description

Sometimes systems have information and other resources that are not considered
public.
These resources should be protected by a secure authentication mechanism that
prevents unauthorized actors from accessing them.

When an actor claims to have a given identity,
the software does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

The software does not perform any authentication for functionality that
requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of
resources.

Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other usersâ€™ identities
temporarily or permanently.

Many web applications and **API**s do not properly protect sensitive data,
such as financial, healthcare, and *PII*.
Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit card
fraud, identity theft, or other crimes.
Sensitive data may be compromised without extra protection,
such as encryption at rest or in transit, and requires special precautions when
exchanged with the browser.
