= R264. Request authentication

== Requirement

The system must require authentication for all resources,
except for the consultation or visualization of those specifically classified
as public.

== Description

Sometimes systems have information and other resources that are not considered
public.
These resources should be protected by a secure authentication mechanism that
prevents unauthorized actors from accessing them.

When an actor claims to have a given identity,
the software does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

The software does not perform any authentication for functionality that
requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of
resources.

Verify that communications between application components,
including APIs, middleware and data layers, are authenticated.
Components should have the least necessary privileges needed.

Verify that the application uses a single vetted authentication mechanism that
is known to be secure,
can be extended to include strong authentication,
and has sufficient logging and monitoring to detect account abuse or breaches.

re- authentication or secondary verification before allowing any sensitive
transactions or account modifications.
