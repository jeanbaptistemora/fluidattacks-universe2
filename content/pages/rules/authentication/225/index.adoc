= R225. Proper authentication responses

== Requirement

System responses to authentication failures
must not indicate which part of the authentication was incorrect.

== Description

Authentication forms are one of the most publicly accessible parts of an
application,
which makes them more susceptible to be attacked.
Most authentication mechanisms require only a username and a password.
If the responses to authentication attempts indicate which authentication
parameter was incorrect,
attackers may be able to obtain a list of valid usernames (user enumeration)
that they can use in brute force attacks.

The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different
circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor,
which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product,
such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

The product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that

Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other usersâ€™ identities
temporarily or permanently.
