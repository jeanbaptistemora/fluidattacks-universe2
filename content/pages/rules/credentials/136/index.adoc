= R136. Force temporary password changing

== Requirement

The system must force the change of automatically generated temporary passwords
after their first use.

== Description

Temporary passwords are often harder to remember and shared over systems whose
future integrity may not be guaranteed by the system that created them.
Therefore, users should be forced to change them after their first use.

Allowing password aging to occur unchecked can result in the possibility of
diminished password integrity.
