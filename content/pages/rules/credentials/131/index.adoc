When setting a new password for a user,
the product does not require knowledge of the original password,
or using another form of authentication.

. [[r2]] link:https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/640.html[CWE-640: Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password]
The software contains a mechanism for users to recover or change their
passwords without knowing the original password,
but the mechanism is weak.

Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other usersâ€™ identities
temporarily or permanently.

Verify that trusted enforcement points such as at access control gateways,
servers, and serverless functions enforce access controls.
Never enforce access controls on the client.

mechanism.
