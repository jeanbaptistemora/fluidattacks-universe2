Application functions related to authentication and session management are
often implemented incorrectly,
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other usersâ€™ identities
temporarily or permanently.

Verify all identity functions
(e.g. forgot password, change password, change email, manage 2FA token, etc.)
have the security controls,
as the primary authentication mechanism (e.g. login form).
