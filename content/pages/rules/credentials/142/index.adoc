= REQ.142 Change system default credentials

== Requirement

The organization must modify
all default access credentials of embedded systems.

== Description

Organizations usually keep default configurations
of third parties products
since these may adapt to most environments where they are installed
and facilitate the deployment to production,
but this practice may leave a default open gate for products
and in most cases credentials found in provider documentation
which can be found easily on internet.
For this reason it's important to check all configurations
before deployment and remove all default credentials
in order to avoid brute force accesses.

==  Implementation

. Remove all default credentials from
product provider

. Implement a mechanism to ensure only users
with administrator privileges can access
to product access consoles

. Create a robust credentials policy
to improve the security of all credentials in the organization.

. The passwords must be changed every so often
 to avoid theft of these.

. Perform audits periodically
to detect misconfigurations or missing patches.


== Attacks

. Brute force attack.
. Information leakage: Technical.


== Attributes

. Layer: Business layer
. Asset: Access credentials
. Scope: Confidentiality
. Phase: Deployment
. Type of Control: Recommendation
