= REQ.161 Define secure default options

== Requirement

Source code must define secure default options
ensuring secure failures in the application.
(+try+, +catch/except; default+ en +switches+)

== Description

The organization must ensure that its own systems and those of third parties
are safe and fully comply with the functions for which they were implemented.
For this, baselines must be implemented from the design
and development phase to avoid bad practices in the development cycles,
e.g the use of conditional without default option,
which can cause unexpected behavior in the system.

The source code in the system is safer
when good programming practices are implemented
since the development stage
ensuring the portability and maintenance of the application.
If a system is difficult to maintain
it will probably exist vulnerabilities within the source code.


== Implementation

. Definition of baselines since design/architecture stages
in order to guarantee the implementation of good programming practices
in the source code development.

. In the development lifecycle there must be a responsible
for the product review from the source code to the system behavior
in order to avoid unexpected behaviors
in final stage of the implementation.

. Quality code and source code vulnerabilities scanners:
They are tools that using lexical and syntactical analyzers
perform code revision, processes it, suggest improvements
and highlight possible vulnerabilities in the development stage.
Using this kind of tools during the development process
helps to improve code performance,
detect logic excessively complex
and simulate security issues that allows the developer
to validate and discard false positives.

== Attacks

. Lead to unexpected behaviors in the application.
. Leak sensitive information from unexpected errors.

== Attributes

* Layer: Application Layer
* Asset: Source Code
* Scope: Matureness
* Phase: Building
* Type of Control: Recommendation
