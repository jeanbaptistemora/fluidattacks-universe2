offering services to identify cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
In the following table, we outline what differentiates us from our competitors:

.Comparative table: Pentesting vs Vulnerability Analysis
[role="tb-row"]
[cols="15,45,40"]
|====
| *Aspect*
| *Fluid Attacks*
| *Others*

a|==== Focus
| {yes} We do security risk hacking only. All day, all the time.
| {no} Only from time to time,
because they do other things besides hacking.

a|==== Independence
| {yes} We don't install, maintain, operate or sell other security products.
With no hidden agendas, you can have confidence
in the independence and impartiality of our reports
link:../../use-cases/continuous-hacking/remediation/[^1^]
link:../../use-cases/one-shot-hacking/[^2^].
| {no}  Since other providers develop, maintain, install or operate
security controls such as `SOC`, `NAC`, Firewalls etc,
they may not be truly impartial nor independent.

a|==== Attributes
a|{yes} We verify the basic security attributes:

* Confidentiality.
* Integrity.
* Availability.

Additionally, we also verify extended attributes such as:

* Privacy.
* Non-repudiation.
* Traceability (logs and error management).
a|{no} Others only verify:

* Confidentiality.
* Integrity.
* Availability.

a|==== Method
| {yes} Automated tools + hands-on expert review (Hybrid).
| {no} Static (automated tools only).

a|==== Team
a|{yes} Our hackers are certified in practical hacking in real scenarios
link:../certifications/[^3^]:

* `OSCE`.
* `OSCP`.
* `OSWP`.
* `CRTE`.

Additionally, they are selected and trained through the most demanding
[button]#link:../../careers/[process]# in the industry,
guaranteeing their ability to program their own tools
and audit code in multiple languages,
effectively making them *programmer-hackers*.

a|{no} Others are only certified in theoretical hacking
through questions and answers:

* `CEH`.

a|==== Model

link:../../use-cases/continuous-hacking/environments/[^10^]
link:../../use-cases/one-shot-hacking/environments/[^11^]:

* For infrastructure (networks, servers, etc),
according to `TCP` and `UDP` open ports.
* For applications, according to inputs
(visible fields, hidden fields, headers and function parameters).
* For source code, according to strictly effectives lines of code (`LoC`).
* For binaries, according to the size in `MiB`
of the software previously installed.
a|{no} Ambiguity or lack of detail in the attack surface:

* For infrastructure, according to `IP` addresses.
* For applications, according to the number of screens
and forms of the application.

a|==== Legacy Languages
a|{yes} We hack legacy applications coded in old-established languages, such as:

* `TAL`.
| {no} No support.

a|==== Development Method
a|{yes} Integrable with any development method, such as:

* Waterfall.

[button]#link:../../use-cases/continuous-hacking/[Continuous Hacking]#,
[button]#link:../../products/integrates/[Integrates]#
and [button]#link:../../asserts/[Asserts]#
fit perfectly for the last 2 use cases.
a|{no} Integrable with a single development method:

* Waterfall.

a|==== Environments
a|* Integration:
[button]#link:../../use-cases/continuous-hacking/[Continuous Hacking]#
and [button]#link:../../asserts/[Asserts]#
fit perfectly for this use case
link:../../use-cases/continuous-hacking/environments/[^12^]
link:../../use-cases/one-shot-hacking/environments/[^13^].
* Staging.
* Production.
a|* Staging.
* Production.

a|==== Windows
a|{yes} In the [button]#link:../../use-cases/continuous-hacking/[Continuous Hacking]# service,
test windows are not required and environments:

* Can change constantly.
* Are not necessarily frozen.
| {no} Frozen environments and test windows are required.

a|==== Coverage
a|{yes} Known
link:../../use-cases/continuous-hacking/environments/[^16^]
link:../../use-cases/one-shot-hacking/environments/[^17^]:

* In fixed scopes, the exact part of the attack surface to be verified,
and its proportion with respect to the total, is agreed upon in advance.

* In variable scopes, the exact part of the attack surface
that was verified, and its proportion
with respect to the total, is reported at the end.
| {no} Unknown, because they may not accurately report
what was tested and what was not.

a|==== Profiling
| {yes} Our product, [button]#link:../../rules/[Rules]#,
allows you to define the security requirements that will be checked
during our hacking service.
| {no} Non-parameterizable.

a|==== Strictness
| {yes} You will know the exact strictness of the hacking
(for inspected and non-inspected
link:#profiling[profiled] requirements)
link:../../use-cases/continuous-hacking/environments/[^18^]

a|{no} In the case of other suppliers:

* Images without annotations.
* Copy-paste of test outcomes which may include false positives.

a|==== Zero Day Vulnerabilities

* An available environment.
* The appropriate authorization.
| {no} No

a|==== Custom Exploits

[button]#link:../../asserts/[Asserts]#.
| {no} Unable to create and execute exploits.

a|==== link:../../blog/importance-pentesting/#diagram[Correlation]
| {yes} By combining vulnerabilities `A` and `B` we are able to find
a new vulnerability `C` of greater impact, which may compromise more registers.

but is not able to correlate them.

a|==== Infection
| {yes} In our [button]#link:../../use-cases/one-shot-hacking/infection/[One-shot hacking]#
service we infect stations and critical servers
using cyberweapons.
| {no} Don't infect or dispose of cyberweapons.

a|==== Compromised Records
a|{yes} After discovering a vulnerability and exploiting it,
we extract the critical business information
which indicates a high impact level.
This allows us to show the severity of any individual vulnerability on:

* Users.
* Passwords.
* Wages.
* Personal IDs.
* Credit card numbers.
* Files in hard disk.
* Central repositories without password.

| {no} No record extraction

a|==== Cycles
| {yes} Multiple cycles in our service: +
{sp} +
[button]#link:../../use-cases/continuous-hacking/[Continuous Hacking]#
link:../../use-cases/continuous-hacking/hacking-tech/[^23^].
| {no}  Only 1.

a|==== link:../../blog/replaced-machines/[Escapes]
| {yes} 0% on the agreed link:#scope[scope].
| {no} ~65% on the agreed link:#scope[scope].

a|==== Remediation
a|{yes} During the project you can request clarifications
directly from our hackers via
[button]#link:../../products/integrates/[Integrates]#.

link:../../use-cases/one-shot-hacking/[^25^].
| {no} No support during the remediation phase.

a|==== Deliverables
a|{yes} Real-time documentation web system
[button]#link:../../products/integrates/[Integrates]#
which allows our customers to auto-generate and supervise
every system from day 1 of the project
link:../../use-cases/continuous-hacking/vuln-manage/[^26^]
link:../../use-cases/one-shot-hacking/vuln-manage/[^27^]:

* Executive report in `PDF`.
* Technical report in `XLS`.
* Technical report in `PDF`.
* Graphics and metrics illustrating the system's security status.

a|{no} Available only at the end of the project
because it is manually generated.

* Word document.
* Tool reports without discarding false positives.

a|==== End
|{yes} Our service ends when the agreed upon scope is completed,
without any increase in cost to you.
link:../../use-cases/continuous-hacking/critical-info/[^28^]
link:../../use-cases/one-shot-hacking/critical-info/[^29^]
|{no} The service ends
when a prior agreed upon time limit for the project runs out.
Therefore, the scope and coverage
are ultimately not defined and therefore unknown.

a|==== Pricing
| {yes} Fixed, according to the previously agreed upon scope.
| {no} Variable, depending on time and materials.
