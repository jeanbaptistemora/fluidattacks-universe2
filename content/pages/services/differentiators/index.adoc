:description: Our Ethical Hacking and Pentesting services seek to find and report all the present security vulnerabilities in your application. It is important to distinguish between a penetration testing performed by Fluid Attacks and a vulnerability analysis using automated tools.

security controls such as +SOC+, +NAC+, Firewalls etc,
they may not be truly impartial nor independent.

* In fixed scopes the exact part of the attack surface to be verified,
and its proportion with respect to the total, is agreed upon in advance.

* In variable scopes, the exact part of the attack surface
that was verified and its proportion
with respect to the total is reported at the end.
