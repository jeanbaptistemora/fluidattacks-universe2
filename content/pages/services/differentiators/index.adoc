a|==== Focus
| {yes} We do security risk hacking only. All day, all the time.
| {no} Only from time to time,
because they do other things besides hacking.

a|==== Independence
| {yes} We don't install, maintain, operate or sell other security products.

link:../../use-cases/one-shot-hacking/[^2^].
| {no}  Since other providers develop, maintain, install or operate
security controls such as `SOC`, `NAC`, Firewalls etc,
they may not be truly impartial nor independent.

a|==== Attributes
a|{yes} We verify the basic security attributes:

* Confidentiality.

a|==== Coverage
a|{yes} Known
link:../../use-cases/continuous-hacking/environments/[^16^]
link:../../use-cases/one-shot-hacking/environments/[^17^]:

* In fixed scopes the exact part of the attack surface to be verified,
and its proportion with respect to the total, is agreed upon in advance.

* In variable scopes, the exact part of the attack surface
that was verified and its proportion
with respect to the total is reported at the end.

* Technical report in `PDF`.
* Graphics on the security of the system.
* Metrics on the security of the system.

a|{no}  Available only at the end of the project
because it is manually generated.

* Word document.
* Tool reports without discarding false positives.

a|==== End
|{yes} Our service ends when the agreed upon scope is completed,
without any increase in cost to you.
link:../../use-cases/continuous-hacking/critical-info/[^28^]
link:../../use-cases/one-shot-hacking/critical-info/[^29^]
|{no} The service ends
when a prior agreed upon time limit for the project runs out.
