:description: In this page we describe our Continuous Hacking service, which aims to detect and report all the vulnerabilities in your application as soon as possible. Our participation in the development life cycle allow us to continuously detect security findings in a development environment.

= Continuous Hacking

The Continuous Hacking service aims to detect and report all vulnerabilities
and security issues during the entire software development cycle.
Our participation during the entire development period
allows us to detect security issues continuously
as the software evolves during development.
The rigorous inspection carried out by our team
allows us to detect all security issues with no false positives
and to check if issues were properly repaired
before the system goes into the production phase.

2+a|== Ethical hacking can start before there is a working environment

Ethical Hacking can start along with code development,
even before a first application version is released.
There's no need to have a working environment to start hacking,
since we are able to analyze source code
published on project's +GIT+ repository.

a|image::hacking-techniques.svg[alt="Source code symbol"]

2+a|== Hacking techniques

* Integral continuous hacking is achieved through application
and infrastructure ethical hacking as well as source code analysis.
In order to perform integral continuous hacking,
access to both +GIT+ repository and integration environment are required.

* In limited continuous ethical hacking
the customer can choose between application ethical hacking
or source code analysis.
In order to perform limited continuous hacking,
access to the +GIT+ repository or the integration environment is required.

2+a|== Healthcheck

When a new continuous ethical hacking subscription starts,
if there were any previous issues
it is necessary to perform a healthcheck.
This means we will attack all versions of the existing code
up to the subscription start point in addition to the monthly test limit
to catch up with the development team
within the first +3+ subscription months.
Then weâ€™ll continue hacking simultaneously as development continues
(healthcheck will have additional fees).

a|image::severity.svg[alt="Checklist"]

2+a|== Severity

Customers are able to decide which security requirements will be tested
on each Ethical Hacking (Profiling) through our
[button]#link:../../products/rules/[Rules]# product.

Customers will know the exact severity for each hacking
(for inspected and non-inspected profiled requirements).

2+a|== Duration

Minimum subscription time for continuous ethical hacking is one year.

a|image::duration.svg[alt="Calendar"]

a|image::attack-cycles.svg[alt="Metal Gear"]

2+a|== Attack Cycles

During the subscription period the selected system
will be attacked multiple times
to test all versions generated during the development phase.
The hacking team will constantly attack the system
even though its functionalities
may have already been attacked in a previous version.

2+a|== Direct and agile communication

All project communication is done through
[button]#link:../../products/integrates/[Integrates]#,
customers can use chat and comments for any project or finding question.

a|image::hacking-envs.svg[alt="Source code inside a scope target"]

2+a|== Hacking environments

Basic service allows customers to choose a single environment
from production, testing or integration.
Customers can also add additional testing environments
for validation with an additional charge.

2+a|== Highly trained hacking team

Our hackers have practical certifications and academic backgrounds
related to security testing.
They perform manual testing and use tools
to guarantee that our reporting includes insecure programming practices,
standard alignment and security regulation compliance,
and findings with specific business impacts.
This enables us to detect Zero Day findings
with no false positive reports.

a|image::exploitation.svg[alt="Computer with an open lock symbol"]

2+a|== Exploitation

As long as we have access to your deployed applications
and we authorize your use of our exploitation engine [button]#link:../../products/asserts/[Asserts]#,
you may reproduce a mock attack that targets a vulnerability
to determine independently if you have eliminated it.

2+a|== Critical information extraction

Whenever findings indicate the need to obtain information,
information extraction is done to maximize finding impacts
without compromising sensitive information.
[button]#link:../../products/integrates/#compromised-records[Example]#.

a|image::follow-up.svg[alt="Bar graph with a continuous line on top"]

2+a|== Follow up using Integrates

During project execution customers can use [button]#link:../../products/integrates/[Integrates]#
to access general information about each finding,
check its remediation status, classify it according to age,
visualize real-time project statistics and progress,
as well as other functionalities.

2+a|== Remediation validation

Multiple finding validation cycles
are performed during the subscription period
to ensure findings have been properly repaired.
We can check if any finding has been successfully closed
as many times as a customer wants us to.
In order to perform this remediation validation
a customer must first define the treatment
used to remediate the vulnerability and then request,
through [button]#link:../../products/integrates/[Integrates]#, a finding validation.

a|image::validate-remediation.svg[alt="Checklist"]

a|image::remediation-support.svg[alt="Question and answer symbol"]

2+a|== Remediation support

During the project, customers can request clarification
on any issue by directly contacting our hackers
through [button]#link:../../products/integrates/[Integrates]#.

2+a|== Generate technical and executive reports from Integrates

The Technical Report provides detailed information
on all security vulnerabilities.
It gives technical personnel a road map for a technical remediation plan.
The Executive Report is an information tool
for use by all a project's stakeholders.
It includes an in-depth findings analysis
and a projected business impact statement,
as well as a summary of the project scope,
methodology used, conclusions and recommendations.

a|image::secure-deletion.svg[alt="Trash can with a cloud behind"]

2+a|== Information gets deleted securely

+7+ days after a customer approves their final report
all information gathered during Ethical Hacking
is deleted securely from all of our systems.
