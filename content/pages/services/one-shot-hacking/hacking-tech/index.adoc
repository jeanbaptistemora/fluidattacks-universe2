= Hacking Techniques, Team, Duration and Cycle

It is possible to perform ethical hacking of the source code, the application or
the infrastructure. You can choose the hacking technique that best suits the
needs of your business to meet the required security assessment of each system.
One-shot hacking, performed with manual testing and use of tools by
Fluid Attacksâ€™ certified hackers, seeks to attack a single version of your
application. Therefore, it has only one inspection cycle on the selected system.
The duration depends on the size of the *ToE* attack surface.
Once all the requirements for starting the project have been met,
each attack will have a defined start and end date.
