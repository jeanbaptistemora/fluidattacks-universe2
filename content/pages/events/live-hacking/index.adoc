= Live Hacking

== 1. Objective

Have you ever wondered how safe are the applications you use everyday?
Those that have access to your personal
and, in some cases, financial information?
Are these applications so safe that the only ones
that may be able to compromise them
are those `hackers` that we have seen on T.V and movies,
who sit in front of a black screen with green letters,
use the keyboard at lighting speed,
and probably speak binary as their second language?

We are sorry to burst your bubble, but the truth is far from that,
and maybe there is no need for such an extraordinary person
to compromise your information.
This is usually because the most common vulnerabilities
found in applications are of the type
`_XSS (Cross Site Scripting)_`, `_SQLi (SQL Injections)_`
`_CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)_` , _Insecure Session Management_
and _Insecure Configurations_, among others;
these vulnerabilities are widely documented,
and their exploitation can be, in some cases, extremely simple,
even without requiring an in-depth knowledge
of computation or programming.

Let's take a look at how our `ethical hackers`
exploit those vulnerabilities to obtain sensitive information,
hijack a session, or even gain root access
over the server running the application.

== 2. Content

In this conference we will use an application named
link:http://www.itsecgames.com/[bWAPP],
which has the particularity of being vulnerable by design (`vbd`),
in such a way that `ethical hackers` and security enthusiasts
can practice their skills and keep improving,
and those who are just starting in this world
can learn how to find and exploit vulnerabilities.

The application will be attacked from different levels:
the web interface and the different services
running inside the server.
Starting from an identification phase
and following with the exploitation
and privilege scalation.

We will also show the programming issues
that cause these vulnerabilities,
always keeping it simple,
so all the assistants, no matter their profession,
can keep up and understand the importance of information security
in a world where applications and devices
are increasing exponentially.

== 3. Experience

This conference was held in the Information Security Workshop
carried out by link:https://www.tigo.com.co/[`TigoUne`].

== 4. Where?

The presentation can be hosted
at your company's facilities or an external venue.

The talk can be given in Medellín, with a minimum audience of `10` assistants.
For other cities in Colombia, Central America, Ecuador and Perú
the minimum audience are `20` assistants.

== 5. Duration

The event duration is `1` hour.

== 6. Public

This conference is suitable for people with basic or low technical knowledge.
The audience limit are `30` assistants.
