= Differentiators

We're an Ethical Hacking and Pentesting company
offering services to identify cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
In the following table, we outline what differentiates us from our competitors:

.Comparative table: Pentesting vs Vulnerability Analysis
[role="tb-row"]
[cols="15,45,40"]
|====
| *Aspect*
| *Fluid Attacks*
| *Others*

a|==== Finding Types
a|* Of a specific business impact.
* Insecure programming practices.
* Alignment with security standards and regulations.
a|* Based on signatures.
* Syntax-based.

a|==== Type of Evidence
a|{yes}  Some of the most relevant evidence is:

* Images of the attack with explanatory annotations.
* Animated `GIFs` of the attack.
a|{no} In the case of other suppliers:

* Images without annotations.
* Copy-paste of test outcomes which may include false positives.

a|==== Zero Day Vulnerabilities
| {yes} Yes link:../../services/continuous-hacking/hacking-tech/[^20^]
| {no} No

a|==== False Positives
| {yes} 0%
| {no} ~20%

a|==== Exploitation
a|{yes} Yes, as long as we have
link:../../services/continuous-hacking/break-build/[^21^]
link:../../services/one-shot-hacking/infection/[^22^]:

* An available environment.
* The appropriate authorization.
| {no} No

a|==== Custom Exploits
| {yes} Using our own exploitation engine
[button]#link:../../asserts/[Asserts]#.
| {no} Unable to create and execute exploits.

a|==== link:../../blog/importance-pentesting/#diagram[Correlation]
| {yes} By combining vulnerabilities `A` and `B` we are able to find
a new vulnerability `C` of greater impact, which may compromise more registers.
| {no} Only detects vulnerabilities `A` and `B`
but is not able to correlate them.

a|==== Infection
| {yes} In our [button]#link:../../services/one-shot-hacking/infection/[One-shot hacking]#
service we infect stations and critical servers
using cyberweapons.
| {no} Don't infect or dispose of cyberweapons.

a|==== Compromised Records
a|{yes} After discovering a vulnerability and exploiting it,
we extract the critical business information
which indicates a high impact level.
This allows us to show the severity of any individual vulnerability on:

* Users.
* Passwords.
* Wages.
* Personal IDs.
* Credit card numbers.
* Files in hard disk.
* Central repositories without password.

| {no} No record extraction

a|==== Cycles
| {yes} Multiple cycles in our service: +
{sp} +
[button]#link:../../services/continuous-hacking/[Continuous Hacking]#
link:../../services/continuous-hacking/hacking-tech/[^23^].
| {no}  Only 1.

a|==== link:../../blog/replaced-machines/[Escapes]
| {yes} 0% on the agreed link:#scope[scope].
| {no} ~65% on the agreed link:#scope[scope].

a|==== Remediation
a|{yes} During the project you can request clarifications
directly from our hackers via
[button]#link:../../products/integrates/[Integrates]#.
link:../../services/continuous-hacking/remediation/[^24^]
link:../../services/one-shot-hacking/[^25^].
| {no} No support during the remediation phase.

a|==== Deliverables
a|{yes} Real-time documentation web system
[button]#link:../../products/integrates/[Integrates]#
which allows our customers to auto-generate and supervise
every system from day 1 of the project
link:../../services/continuous-hacking/vuln-manage/[^26^]
link:../../services/one-shot-hacking/vuln-manage/[^27^]:

* Executive report in `PDF`.
* Technical report in `XLS`.
* Technical report in `PDF`.
* Graphics and metrics illustrating the system's security status.

a|{no} Available only at the end of the project
because it is manually generated.

* Word document.
* Tool reports without discarding false positives.

a|==== End
|{yes} Our service ends when the agreed upon scope is completed,
without any increase in cost to you.
link:../../services/continuous-hacking/critical-info/[^28^]
link:../../services/one-shot-hacking/critical-info/[^29^]
|{no} The service ends
when a prior agreed upon time limit for the project runs out.
Therefore, the scope and coverage
are ultimately not defined and therefore unknown.

a|==== Pricing
| {yes} Fixed, according to the previously agreed upon scope.
| {no} Variable, depending on time and materials.
