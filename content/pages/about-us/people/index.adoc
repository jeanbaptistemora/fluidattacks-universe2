We are a dedicated and enthusiastic company.
We are focused on software hacking,
finding vulnerabilities in a wide range of information systems
comprehensively and passionately, and ASAP for all our clients.
Technology and cybersecurity are part of our DNA;
we are always attacking, testing, and developing new applications;
we are continuously evolving.

Our highly certified experts make up a robust red team
that can be divided into some sub-teams depending on their specialties
that can cover everything from attacks and re-attacks to escapes and releases.
These experts are responsible for helping our clients
discover their cybersecurity risks
and providing them with sufficient guidance to remediate vulnerabilities
so that they can offer their users genuinely secure systems.

Besides, these experts work alongside
other marketing and management professionals who,
with their extensive knowledge and commitment,
end up giving sufficient support to the organization
we proudly built and called `Fluid Attacks`.
