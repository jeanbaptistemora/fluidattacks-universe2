.Comparative table Pentesting Vs Vulnerability Analysis

[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|====
| Aspect
| FLUIDAttacks
| Others

a|==== Focus 
| {yes} We only hack, all day, all projects, all hackers.
| {no} Only from time to time, 
because they do other things besides hacking.

a|==== Independence
| {yes} We don't solve nor install any kind of control, 
thus we always report all the vulnerabilities with the maximum independence.
| {no} Since other providers develop, maintain, install 
or operate security controls such as +SOC+, +NAC+, +Firewalls+ etc, 
they are not independent to report the vulnerabilities 
for which they are responsible.

a|==== Method
| {yes} Hybrid (Automated tools + manual expert revision).
| {no} Static (Automated tools only).

a|==== Team
a|{yes} Our hackers are certified in practical hacking in real scenarios:

* +OSCP+.
* +OSWP+.
* +CEH+. 

Additionally they are selected and trained through the most demanding
[button]#link:../../careers/[process]# in the industry, 
guaranteeing  their ability to program their own tools 
and audit code in multiple languages, that is to say 
they are *programmer-hackers*

a|{no} They are certified in theoretical hacking 
through questions and answers:

* +CEH+.

// Winners
//{yes} We have always finished in *first (1) place in all (4 of 4)*  
//Capture the Flag (+CTF+) events for suppliers selection 
//made by our customers.
//{no} They finish in second or third place, 
//or even not participate at all 
//when the selection process involves Capture the Flag (+CTF+).

a|==== Model

a|==== link:../../blog/delimit-ethical-hacking/[Scope]
a|{yes} Precision and granularity in the attack surface:

* For infrastructure (networks, servers, etc), 
according to +TCP+ and +UDP+ open ports.
* For applications, according to inputs
(visible fields, hidden fields, headers and function parameters).
* For source code, according to strictly effectives lines of code (+LoC+).
* For binaries, according to the size in +MiB+ 
of the software previously installed.
a|{no} Ambiguity or lack of detail in the attack surface:

* For infrastructure, according to +IP+ addresses.
* For applications, according to the number of screens 
and forms of the application.

a|==== Legacy Languages
a|{yes} We hack legacy applications coded in old-established languages, such as:

* +COBOL+. 
* +RPG+.
* +PL1+.
* +TAL+.
| {no} No support.

a|==== Development Method
a|{yes} Integrable with any development method, such as:

* Waterfall.
* Agile.
* +DevOps+. 

[button]#link:../../services/continuous-hacking/[Continuous Hacking]#, 
[button]#link:../../products/integrates/[Integrates]# 
and [button]#link:../../products/asserts/[Asserts]#
fit perfect for the last 2 use cases.
a|{no} Integrable with a single development method:

* Waterfall.

a|==== Environments
a|* Integration: 
[button]#link:../../services/continuous-hacking/[Continuous Hacking]# 
and [button]#link:../../products/asserts/[Asserts]#
fit perfectly in this use case.
* Staging.
* Production.
a|* Staging.
* Production.

a|==== Windows
a|{yes} In the [button]#link:../../services/continuous-hacking/[Continuous Hacking]# 
service environments:

* Can constantly change.
* Not necessarily are frozen.
* Windows are not required for hacking.
| {no} Frozen environments and test windows are required.

a|==== Coverage
a|{yes} Known:

* In fixed scopes, it is agreed the exact part of the attack surface 
that will be verified and its proportion with respect to the total.

* In variable scopes, the exact part of the attack surface 
that was verified and its proportion 
with respect to the total is reported at the end.
| {no} Unknown, because they never accurately report 
what was tested and what was not.

a|==== Profiling
| {yes} You decide the security requirements that we will check 
during the hacking service 
through our product [button]#link:../../products/rules/[Rules]#. 
| {no} Non parameterizable. 

a|==== Strictness
| {yes} You will know the exact strictness of the hacking
(For inspected and non inspected 
link:#profiling[profiled] requirements).
| {no} Unknown.

a|==== Finding Types
a|* Of a specific business impact.
* Insecure programming practices.
* Alignment with security standards and regulations.
a|* Based on signatures.
* Syntax-based.

a|==== Type of Evidences
a|{yes} Some of the most relevant evidences are:

* Images of the attack with explanatory annotations.
* Animated +GIFs+ of the attack 
(link:../../products/integrates/#vulnerability-evidences[example]).
a|{no} In the case of other suppliers:

* Images without annotations.
* Copy-paste of tools outcome without
discarding false positives through attacks.

[button]#link:../../products/asserts/[Asserts]# 
(link:../../products/integrates/#exploit[example]).
| {no}

a|==== link:../../blog/protect-organization-hacker-lamer/#diagram[Correlation]
| {yes} By combining vulnerabilities +A+ and +B+ we are able to find 
a new vulnerability +C+ of greater impact which may compromise more registers.
| {no} Only detects vulnerabilities +A+ and +B+ but it's not able to correlate them. 

a|==== Infection
| {yes} In our [button]#link:../../services/one-shot-hacking/[One shot hacking]# 
service we infect stations and critical servers 
using our custom cyberweapon
[button]#link:../../products/commands/[Commands]#.
| {no} Don't infect or dispose of custom cyberweapons.

a|==== Compromised Records
a|{yes} After discover a vulnerability and exploit it, 
we extract the business critical information 
which evidences a high impact allowing us to show 
the severity of a vulnerability withouth regarding the technical aspect:

* Users.
* Passwords.
* Wages.
* Personal IDs.
* Credit card numbers.
* Files in hard disk.
* Central repositories without password.

link:../../products/integrates/#compromised-records[Example].
| {no} No record extraction

a|==== Cycles

a|* During the project you can request clarifications 
directly to our hackers via
[button]#link:../../products/integrates/[Integrates]# 
(link:../../products/integrates/#doubts-regarding-the-vulnerabilities[example]).
* You can use our detailed remediation guides via
[button]#link:../../products/defends/[Defends]#.
| {no} No support during remediation phase.

a|==== Deliverables
a|{yes} Real-time documentation web system
[button]#link:../../products/integrates/[Integrates]#

* Metrics on the security of the system (link:../../products/integrates/#project-statistics[example]).

a|{no} Available only at the end of the project due to 
its manual elaboration.

* Word document.
* Tool reports without discarding false positives.

a|==== End
|{yes} Our service ends when the agreed scope is reached, 
without prices augmentation
|{no} The service ends when the agreed time runs out, 
therefore the scope and coverage of the hack 
are indeterminate at the end of the service.
