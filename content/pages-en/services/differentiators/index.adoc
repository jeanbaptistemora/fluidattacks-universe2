:description: Our Ethical Hacking and Pentesting services seek to find and report all the present security vulnerabilities in your application. It is important to distinguish between a penetration testing performed by FLUID and a vulnerability analysis using automated tools.

{description} To this end, we present the following comparative table:

.Comparative table Pentesting Vs Vulnerability Analysis
[role="tb-fluid tb-row"]
[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|====
| Aspect
| FLUIDAttacks
| Others

a|==== Revision Method
| Hybrid (Automated tools + manual expert revision)
| Static (Automated tools only)

a|==== Professional Profile
a|* +OSCP+
* +OSWP+
* +CEH+ 

Additionally our hackers are excellent programmers, 
allowing us to maximize the depth of the tests
| None

a|==== Model
| +Red Team+
| Vulnerability Analysis with selective exploitation

a|==== Targets
a|* Applications
* +APIs+
* Mobile apps
* Servers
* Networks
* +IoT+ Devices
* Industrial Control Systems (+ICS+)
* Security Operations Centers (+SOC+)
| Web

a|==== Scope Definition
a|* For infrastructure, according to +TCP+ and +UDP+ open ports
* For applications, according to inputs
(visible fields, hidden fields, and headers)
* For source code, according to strictly effectives lines of code (+LoC+).
a|* For infrastructure, according to +IP+ addresses.
* For applications, according to number of applications.

a|==== Legacy Languages
a|* +COBOL+ 
* +RPG+
* +PL1+
* +TAL+
| No support

a|==== Coverage
| Known (arranged or resulting)
| Unknown

a|==== Strictness
a|* You decide the security requirements 
that we will check in the inspection process (profiling) 
through our product [button]#link:../../products/rules/[Rules>>]# 
* Additionally you will know the exact strictness of the hacking
(For inspected and non inspected code)
| Non parameterizable and unknown

a|==== Environments
a|* Integration: 
[button]#link:../../services/continuous-hacking/[Continuous Hacking>>]# 
and [button]#link:../../products/asserts/[Asserts>>]#
fit perfectly in this use case.
* Staging
* Production
a|* Staging
* Production

a|==== Finding Types
a|* Of a specific business impact
* Insecure programming practices
* Alignment with security standards and regulations
a|* Based on signatures
* Syntax-based

a|==== Type of Evidences
a|* Images
* Animated +GIFs+.
link:../../products/integrates/#vulnerability-evidences[Example]
a|* Automated tool output
* Images

a|==== ZERO DAY Vulnerabilities
| {yes}
| {no}

a|==== False Positives
| {yes} 0%
| {no} ~20%

a|==== Exploitation
| 100%
| Variable

a|==== Creation of Own Exploits
| {yes} Using our own exploitation engine.
[button]#link:../../products/asserts/[Asserts>>]# .
link:../../products/integrates/#exploit[Example]
| {no}

a|==== Vulnerability correlation
| By combining vulnerabilities +A+ and +B+ we are able to find 
a new vulnerability +C+ of greater impact which may compromise more registers.
| Only detects vulnerabilities +A+ and +B+ but it's not able to correlate them. 

a|==== Compromised Records
| {yes} link:../../products/integrates/#compromised-records[Example]
| {no}

a|==== Inspection Cycles
| Multiple cyles in our service 
[button]#link:../../services/continuous-hacking/[Continuous Hacking>>]#
| Only 1

a|==== link:../../blog/replaced-machines/[Leaks (Yield)]
| 0% of the target of evaluation
| ~65% of the target of evaluation

a|==== Remediation Support
a|* During the project you can request clarifications 
directly to our hackers via
[button]#link:../../products/integrates/[Integrates>>]# 
* You can use our detailed remediation guides via
[button]#link:../../products/defends/[Defends>>]# 
| {no}

a|==== Deliverables
| Real-time documentation web system
[button]#link:../../products/integrates/[Integrates>>]#
a|* Manually-made Word document.
* Tool reports without discarding false positives
