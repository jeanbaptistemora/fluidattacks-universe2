.Comparative table Pentesting Vs Vulnerability Analysis
[role="tb-row"]
[cols="15,45,40"]
|====
| *Aspect*
| *FLUIDAttacks*
| *Others*

a|==== Focus
| {yes} We only hack, all day, all projects, all hackers.
| {no} Only from time to time,
because they do other things besides hacking.

a|==== Independence
| {yes} We don't solve nor install any kind of control,
thus we always report all the vulnerabilities with the maximum independence
link:../continuous-hacking/#remediation-support[^1^]
link:../one-shot-hacking/#remediation[^2^].
| {no} Since other providers develop, maintain, install
or operate security controls such as +SOC+, +NAC+, +Firewalls+ etc,
they are not independent to report the vulnerabilities
for which they are responsible.

a|==== Attributes
a|{yes} We verify the basic security attributes:

* Confidentiality.
* Integrity.
* Availability.

Additionally we also verify extended attributes such as:

* Privacy.
* Non-repudiation.
* Traceability (logs and errors management).
a|{no} They only verify:

* Confidentiality.
* Integrity.
* Availability.

a|==== Method
| {yes} Automated tools + hands-on expert review (Hybrid).
| {no} Static (Automated tools only).

a|==== Team
a|{yes} Our hackers are certified in practical hacking in real scenarios
link:../continuous-hacking/#highly-trained-hacking-team[^3^]
link:../one-shot-hacking/#highly-trained-hacking-team[^4^]:

* +OSCP+.
* +OSWP+.

Additionally they are selected and trained through the most demanding
[button]#link:../../careers/[process]# in the industry,
guaranteeing  their ability to program their own tools
and audit code in multiple languages, that is to say
they are *programmer-hackers*

a|{no} They are certified in theoretical hacking
through questions and answers:

* +CEH+.

// Winners
//{yes} We have always finished in *first (1) place in all (4 of 4)*
//Capture the Flag (+CTF+) events for suppliers selection
//made by our customers.
//{no} They finish in second or third place,
//or even not participate at all
//when the selection process involves Capture the Flag (+CTF+).

* In fixed scopes, it is agreed the exact part of the attack surface
that will be verified and its proportion with respect to the total.

* In variable scopes, the exact part of the attack surface
that was verified and its proportion
with respect to the total is reported at the end.
