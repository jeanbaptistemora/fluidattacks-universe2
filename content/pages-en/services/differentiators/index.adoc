:description: Our Ethical Hacking and Pentesting services seek to find and report all the present security vulnerabilities in your application. It is important to distinguish between a penetration testing performed by FLUID and a vulnerability analysis using automated tools.

{description} To this end, we present the following comparative table:

.Comparative table Pentesting Vs Vulnerability Analysis
[role="tb-fluid tb-row"]
[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|====
| Aspect
| FLUIDAttacks
| Others

a|==== Focus 
| {yes} We only hack, all day, all projects, all hackers.
| {no} Only from time to time, 
because they do other things besides hacking.

a|==== Independence
| {yes} We only hack, we don't solve, repair nor install any kind of control, 
thus we always report all the vulnerabilities with the maximum independence.
| {no} Since other providers develop, maintain, install 
or operate security controls such as +SOC+, +NAC+, +Firewalls+ etc, 
they are not independent to report the vulnerabilities 
for which they are responsible.

a|==== Method
| Hybrid (Automated tools + manual expert revision).
| Static (Automated tools only).

a|==== Team
a|* +OSCP+.
* +OSWP+.
* +CEH+. 

Additionally our hackers are excellent programmers, 
allowing us to maximize the depth of the tests.
| {no} None.

a|==== CTF winners
| {yes} In the 100% of the selection processes 
made by providers (4) using +CTF+ (Capture the flag) 
to select their hacking provider 
FLUID has finished in first place in the technical evaluation. 
| {no} In some occasions they don't participate in the +CTF+ process, 
or they finish in second place or lower.

a|==== Model
| +Red Team+.
| Vulnerability Analysis with selective exploitation.

a|==== Targets
a|* Web applications.
* Mobile applications (iPhone, Android).
* Desktop applications (+GUI+).
* Mainframe applications (+AS400+).
* Embedded applications (+POS+, +ATM+).
* +APIs+ (+SOAP+, +REST+, +GraphQL+).
* Servers.
* Networks.
* +IoT+ Devices.
* Industrial Control Systems (+ICS+).
* Security Operations Centers (+SOC+).
a|* Web applications.
* Servers.
* Networks.

a|==== Techniques
a|{yes} 1 service, all the techniques:

* Fuzzing.
* DAST (Dynamic Analysis Security Testing).
* SAST (Static Analysis Security Testing).
* IAST (Interactive Application Security Testing).
* SCA (Software Composition Analysis).
* Manual code review.
* Reversing (if source is not provided).
* False positive elimination.
* Exploitation with public exploits.
* Exploitation with private exploits.
* Exploitation with custom exploits.
* User enumeration.
* Password guessing.
* Password cracking.
* Trojan infection.
| {no} Only 1 technique per product.

a|==== Scope
a|* For infrastructure, according to +TCP+ and +UDP+ open ports.
* For applications, according to inputs
(visible fields, hidden fields, and headers).
* For source code, according to strictly effectives lines of code (+LoC+).
a|* For infrastructure, according to +IP+ addresses.
* For applications, according to number of applications.

a|==== Legacy Languages
a|* +COBOL+. 
* +RPG+.
* +PL1+.
* +TAL+.
| {no} No support.

a|==== Development Method
a|* Waterfall.
* Agile.
* +DevOps+. 

[button]#link:../../services/continuous-hacking/[Continuous Hacking]#, 
[button]#link:../../products/integrates/[Integrates]# 
and [button]#link:../../products/asserts/[Asserts]#
fit perfect for the last 2 use cases.
| Waterfall.

a|==== Coverage
| {yes} Known (arranged or resulting).
| {no} Unknown.

a|==== Profiling
| {yes} You decide the security requirements that we will check 
during the hacking service 
through our product [button]#link:../../products/rules/[Rules]#. 
| {no} Non parameterizable. 

a|==== Strictness
| {yes} You will know the exact strictness of the hacking
(For inspected and non inspected code).
| {no} Unknown.

a|==== Environments
a|* Integration: 
[button]#link:../../services/continuous-hacking/[Continuous Hacking]# 
and [button]#link:../../products/asserts/[Asserts]#
fit perfectly in this use case.
* Staging.
* Production.
a|* Staging.
* Production.

a|==== Windows
a|In the [button]#link:../../services/continuous-hacking/[Continuous Hacking]# 
service environments:

* Can constantly change.
* Not necessarily are frozen.
* Windows are not required for hacking.
| {no} Frozen environments and test windows are required.

a|==== Finding Types
a|* Of a specific business impact.
* Insecure programming practices.
* Alignment with security standards and regulations.
a|* Based on signatures.
* Syntax-based.

a|==== Type of Evidences
a|{yes} Some of the most relevant evidences are:
* Images of the attack with explanatory annotations.
* Animated +GIFs+ of the attack.
link:../../products/integrates/#vulnerability-evidences[Example]
a|{no} In the case of other suppliers:

* Images without annotations.
* Copy-paste of tools outcome without
discarding false positives through attacks.

a|==== Zero Day Vulnerabilities
| {yes}
| {no}

a|==== False Positives
| {yes} 0%
| {no} ~20%

a|==== Exploitation
| {yes} As long as we have an available environment 
and the appropriate authorization.
| {no}

a|==== Custom Exploits
| {yes} Using our own exploitation engine
[button]#link:../../products/asserts/[Asserts]#. 
link:../../products/integrates/#exploit[Example].
| {no}

a|==== Correlation
| By combining vulnerabilities +A+ and +B+ we are able to find 
a new vulnerability +C+ of greater impact which may compromise more registers.
| Only detects vulnerabilities +A+ and +B+ but it's not able to correlate them. 

a|==== Infection
| {yes} In our [button]#link:../../services/one-shot-hacking/[One shot hacking]# 
service we infect stations and critical servers 
using our custom cyberweapon
[button]#link:../../products/commands/[Commands]#.
| {no} Don't infect or dispose of custom cyberweapons.

a|==== Compromised Records
| {yes} link:../../products/integrates/#compromised-records[Example].
| {no}

a|==== Cycles
| {yes} Multiple cycles in our service 
[button]#link:../../services/continuous-hacking/[Continuous Hacking]#.
| {no}  Only 1.

a|==== link:../../blog/replaced-machines/[Leaks]
| {yes} 0% on the agreed link:#scope[scope].
| {no} ~65% on the agreed link:#scope[scope].

a|==== Remediation
a|* During the project you can request clarifications 
directly to our hackers via
[button]#link:../../products/integrates/[Integrates]#. 
link:../../products/integrates/#doubts-regarding-the-vulnerabilities[Example]
* You can use our detailed remediation guides via
[button]#link:../../products/defends/[Defends]#.
| {no}

a|==== Deliverables
