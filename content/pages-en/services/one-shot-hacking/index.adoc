= One-Shot Hacking

The One Shot Hacking service aims to detect and report all vulnerabilities
and security issues within one specific version of your application.
The rigorous inspection carried out by our team allows us to detect
all existing security issues with no false positives.

a|== Testing techniques
It's possible to perform source code,
application or infrastructure Ethical Hacking.
Customers are able to choose which testing technique
suit best their needs regarding each system requiring security assessment.

a|== Coverage

Ethical Hacking can be done to achieve specific coverage,
variable coverage or full coverage.

Specific coverage refers to a system
where its overall size can be assessed
(application fields, lines of code, open ports)
and the customer chooses to cover only a specific percentage of the system.

Variable coverage refers to a system where its overall size cannot be assessed
and specific scope is predefined
(fixed number of application fields, lines of code or open ports).
Testing ends when the target size is achieved,
regardless of the total size the system has.

Full coverage refers to a system where its overall size can be assessed
(application fields, lines of code, open ports)
and the customer chooses to cover the entire system.

a|== Strictness

Customers are able to decide which security requirements will be tested
on each Ethical Hacking (Profiling)
through our [button]#link:../../products/rules/[Rules]# product

Customers will know the exact Ethical Hacking strictness for each test
(For inspected and non-inspected profiled requirements).

a|== Specific length

Depending on system size, a typical Ethical hacking
lasts between +1+ and +4+ weeks.

a|== Follow up

Each project will have a project manager,
so customers can express their needs before, during and after execution.

a|== Scheduled ethical hacking

After all requirements to start an Ethical hacking have been met,
each test will have a defined start and finishing date.

a|== Testing environments

Customers are able to choose one testing environment
from their available software environments
(production, development, integration, etc.)

a|== Highly trained hacking team

Our hackers are certified in practical hacking in real scenarios,
they also have security related studies,
they are able to perform manual testing and also use tools
to guarantee the reporting of several types of findings
including those with specific business impact,
those regarding insecure programming practices,
and those regarding standard alignment and security regulation compliance,
enabling us to detect +Zero Day+ findings,
all with no false positives reports.

a|== Exploitation

As long as we have access to deployed applications and customer authorization,
using our own exploitation engine [button]#link:../../products/asserts/[Asserts]#.

a|== Critical information extraction

Whenever findings allow the extraction of information,
all compromised records are extracted to maximize finding impact
and compromise sensible information.

a|== Infection

Whenever findings allow it, infrastructure gets infected
with malicious files in order to get additional information,
infect servers and verify network controls.
We use +Shells+ and customized +Trojans+ with previous customer authorization.

a|== Daily progress reports

Daily progress reports are sent via e-mail,
report include coverage, strictness, partial result and overall progress.

a|== Finding follow up using Integrates

Customers can check out finding status during project execution
using our [button]#link:../../products/integrates/[Integrates]# product.

^.^a|image:img15.png[alt="img15", width="55%"]

a|== Remediation

During the project, customers can request clarifications
directly from our hackers
via [button]#link:../../products/integrates/[Integrates]#.

Customers can use our detailed remediation guides
via [button]#link:../../products/defends/[Defends]#.

a|== Secured reports delivery

Definitive reports delivery with evidences
through a secured file transfer website

^.^a|image:img17.png[alt="img17", width="55%"]

a|== Report validation meeting

Meeting with the technical team in order to validate the reports
and listen to observations.
This meeting can arranged face-to-face or remote,
according to the customer needs.

a|== Deliver meeting

Formal presentation of executive reports to all the stakeholders.
It consists of two face-to-face meetings: one for results validation
and another for overall socialization.

^.^a|image:img19.png[alt="img19", width="55%"]

a|== Secured information erase

+7+ business days after the final approval of the reports,
all information is erased from our systems

a|== Closure verification (Optional)

A single cycle validation of the status of the findings is made
up to +3+ months after the final approval of the initial reports.
To arrange this, it is necessary that the customer shares the initial reports again
and guarantees access to the testing environment.
The validation only covers the findings which were previously reported,
new vulnerabilities are not searched.
