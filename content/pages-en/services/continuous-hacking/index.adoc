= Continuous Hacking

*Find and Report all existing security vulnerabilities within your information technology system.*

== Early tests on the SDLC:

* Minimizing the cost of repair.
* Reducing to zero the time of security certifications.
* Certifying an effective closure of the vulnerabilities within the continuous integration of the projects.

== Why do we do it??

* *Time to market*: organizations want to release more features in less time.
* *Range*: accomplish a coverage from 100% without raising the times of releasing.
* *Mitigation*: close vulnerabilities before releasing new features.
* *Precision*: expert evolutionary reviews.

== How?

* Continuous Ethical Hacking on the source code and applications. (Expert review)
* Automate closure of confirmed vulnerabilities.
