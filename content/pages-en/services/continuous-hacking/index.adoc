= Continuous Hacking

*Find all existing vulnerabilities and report them as soon as possible.*

== Early tests in the SDLC:

* Minimizing the cost of remediation.
* Reducing security certification time to zero.
* Certifying an effective closure of the vulnerabilities within the continuous integration of the projects.

== Why do we do it??

* *Time to market*: organizations want to release more features in less time.
* *Coverage*: accomplish a coverage of 100% without increasing release times.
* *Mitigation*: close vulnerabilities before releasing new features.
* *Precision*: expert evolutionary reviews.

== How?

* Continuous Ethical Hacking on the source code, applications and infrastructure. (Expert review)
* Automate closure of confirmed vulnerabilities.
