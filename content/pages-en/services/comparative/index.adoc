:description: Our Ethical Hacking and Pentesting services seek to find and report all the present security vulnerabilities in your application. It is important to distinguish between a penetration testing performed by FLUID and a vulnerability analysis using automated tools.

{description} To this end, we present the following comparative table:

.Comparative table Pentesting Vs Vulnerability Analysis
[role="tb-fluid tb-row"]
[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|====
| Aspect
| FLUIDAttacks
| Others

| Revision Method
| Hybrid (Automated tools + manual expert revision)
| Static (Automated tools only)

| Model
| +Red Team+
| Vulnerability Analysis with selective exploitation

| Coverage
| Known (arranged or resulting)
| Unknown

| Scope Definition
a|* For infrastructure, according to +TCP+ and +UDP+ open ports
* For applications, according to inputs
(visible fields, hidden fields, and headers)
* For source code, according to strictly effectives lines of code (+LoC+).
a|* For infrastructure, according to +IP+ addresses.
* For applications, according to number of applications.


| Professional Profile
a|* +OSCP+
* +OSWP+
* +CEH+ 

Additionally our hackers are excellent programmers, 
allowing us to maximize the depth of the tests
| None

| Compromised Records
| {yes}
| {no}

| Exploitation
| 100%
| Variable

| Creation of Own Exploits
| {yes} Using our own exploitation engine.

| {no}

| +ZERO DAY+ Vulnerabilities
| {yes}
| {no}

| False Positives
| {no}
| {yes} (~20%)

| Remediation Support
a|* During the project you can request clarifications 
directly to our hackers via
[button]#link:../../products/integrates/[Integrates>>]# 
* You can use our detailed remediation guides via
[button]#link:../../products/defends/[Defends>>]# 
| {no}

| Strictness
a|* You decide the security requirements 
that we will check in the inspection process (profiling) 
through our product [button]#link:../../products/rules/[Rules>>]# 
* Additionally you will know the exact strictness of the hacking
(For inspected and non inspected code)
| Non parameterizable and unknown

| Targets
a|* Applications
* +APIs+
* Mobile apps
* Servers
* Networks
* +IoT+ Devices
* Industrial Control Systems(+ICS+)
* Security Operations Centers (+SOC+)
| Web

| Inspection Cycles
| Multiple cyles in our service 
[button]#link:../../services/continuous-hacking/[Continuous Hacking>>]#
| Only 1

| Environments
a|* Production
* Staging
* Integration
| Production

| Vulnerability correlation
| By combining vulnerabilities +A+ and +B+ we are able to find 
a new vulnerability +C+ of greater impact which may compromise more registers.
| Only detects vulnerabilities +A+ and +B+ but it's not able to correlate them. 

| Finding Types
a|* Of a specific business impact
* Insecure programming practices
* Alignment with security standards and regulations
a|* Based on signatures
* Syntax-based

| 0% of the target of evaluation
| ~65% of the target of evaluation

| Type of Evidences
a|* Images
* Animated +GIFs+. Example

a|* Automated tool output
* Images

| Deliverables
| Real-time documentation web system
