Level 0 headers are created
by preceeding the title
with one equal sign,
like this:

= Test several Asciidoc styles and functionalities
....

[[cheat-sheet]]
== Asciidoc Cheat Sheet

Level 1 headers are created
the same way as level 0,
except one more equal sign is used.

You can also set an ``id'' HTML attribute to the titles
by doing the following,
which will set the ``id'' of the header
to ``cheat-sheet'':

=== Tables

....
.Title
[options="header"] -> Optional
|====
|Col 1|Col 2      |Col 3
|1    |Item 1     |a
|2    |Item 2     |b
|3    |Item 3     |c
|6    |Three items|d
|====
....

.An example table
[options="header"]
|====
|Col 1|Col 2      |Col 3
|1    |Item 1     |a
|2    |Item 2     |b
|3    |Item 3     |c
|6    |Three items|d
|====

The previous was the most simple table,
more options can be set:

....
[grid="rows",format="csv"]
[options="header",cols="^,<,<s,<,>m"]
|====
ID,FName,LName,Address,Phone
1,Vasya,Pupkin,London,+123
2,X,Y,"A,B",45678
|====

grid -> Sets borders
format -> Sets the delimiter character between columns
header -> The first column are headers
cols -> Sets format of the columns
  ^  align center in the row
  <  align left in the row
  <s align left in the row and font strong (bold)
  >m align right in the row and font monospaced

The CSS of the site overrides some of the previous.
....

[grid="rows",format="csv"]
[options="header",cols="^,<,<s,<,>m"]
|====
ID,FName,LName,Address,Phone
1,Vasya,Pupkin,London,+123
2,X,Y,"A,B",45678
|====

Table cells can also be styled
to occupy multiple rows.

....
.Multiline cells, row/col span

|Date |Duration |Avg HR |Notes

|22-Aug-08 .2+^.^|10:24 | 157 |

heart rate) by going hard
for this interval.

|22-Aug-08 | 152 |
Back-to-back with previous interval.

|24-Aug-08 3+^|none
|====

.2+^.^ -> Occupy two cells vertically and align center
          horizontally and vertically
3+^    -> Occupy 3 cells horizontally and align center horizontally

=== Lists

* There are only 10 kinds of people in this world:
  - Those who understand binary.
  - Those who don't.

Lists are created by preceeding a (*) to an item.
Other delimiters, like a hyphen (-),
can also be used to declarate a list.
When combined, a nested list can be created.

Ordered list can also be nested

....
. List1
.. List 2
... List 3
and so on
....

. List 1
.. List 2
... List 3
.... List 4
..... List 5

In order to keep content in the correct indentation level,
a plus sign (+) is placed in the blank line
between the content.
