= Test several Asciidoc styles and functionalities

Level 0 headers are created
by preceeding the title
with one equal sign,
like this:

....
= Test several Asciidoc styles and functionalities
....

[[cheat-sheet]]
== Asciidoc Cheat Sheet

Level 1 headers are created
the same way as level 0,
except one more equal sign is used.

You can also set an ``id'' HTML attribute to the titles
by doing the following,
which will set the ``id'' of the header
to ``cheat-sheet'':

=== Text Style

As can be expected,
level 2 headers have one more equal sign.

Now, some rules
that allow text formatting:

* A phrase is placed inside `single quotes'
by surrounding it with a tick to the left (`)
and a single quote to the right (')
* A phrase is placed inside ``double quotes''
by surrounding it with two ticks to the left (\`\`)
and two single quotes to the right ('')
* Single quotes (\'emphasis') around a phrase
place 'emphasis',
* Astericks (\*bold*) around a phrase
make the text *bold*,
* Double astericks (l\*\*e\**tters) around one or more l**e**tters in a word
 make those letters bold,
* Double underscore (\__phr\__ase) around a __sub__string in a word
emphasizes that substring,
* Use carrots (\^super\^string) around characters
to make them ^super^script,
* Use tildes (\~subs\~tring) around characters
to make them ~sub~script,
* To use +monospaced+ characters,
enclose the phrase in plus signs (\+phrase+)
* To pass through +++<u>HTML</u>+++ directly,
surround the text with triple plus signs.
* To force a line break, +
a plus sign (+) must be used at the end of the sentence.
* To escape special characters,
the backslash is used (\),
* Reserved XML characters like <, > and &,
can be used safely,
* Force a space{sp}between inline elements
using the \{sp} attribute,
* Hold text together
with an intrinsic non-breaking{nbsp}space attribute, \{nbsp}
* Claim copyright (C), registered trademark (R) or trademark (TM)

=== Tables

A table is delimited,
at the beginning and at the end,
by (|===).
The columns are separated by a pipe (|).

.An example table
[options="header"]
|====
|Col 1|Col 2      |Col 3
|1    |Item 1     |a
|2    |Item 2     |b
|3    |Item 3     |c
|6    |Three items|d
|====

=== Lists

* Q: How did the programmer die in the shower? +
  A: He read the shampoo instructions:

  . Lather, rinse.
  . Repeat.

* There are only 10 kinds of people in this world:
  - Those who understand binary.
  - Those who don't.

Lists are created by preceeding a (*) to an item.
Other delimiters, like a hyphen (-),
can also be used to declarate a list.
When combined, a nested list can be created.

Ordered list can also be nested

. List 1
.. List 2
... List 3
.... List 4
..... List 5

In order to keep content in the correct indentation level,
a plus sign (+) is placed in the blank line
between the content.
