Terms of the contractual relationship between +Fluid Attacks+ and its PARTNERS
(be them channels or integrators).
Commissions, cut-off dates,  and goals to be achieved
to stay within a commission range are specified, among other aspects.
These can change at any time and are established
only by signing the physical document.

. +Fluid Attacks+ together with the PARTNER
will set the final sale price for each CUSTOMER.

. The final price for the CUSTOMER will be the base value
used to calculate the commission to be paid to the PARTNER.

. +Fluid Attacks+ will always be a visible brand to the end CUSTOMER.
Co-branding is also an option, but white-labeling is not.

. All the PARTNERS start with a minimum commission of *30%*,
until *2 cut-off dates* have elapsed.

. The cut-off date will be *December 31* of each year.

. Every *15th of January* after the second cut-off date,
the growth of the cash collected by +Fluid Attacks+
between the two previous cut-off dates will be evaluated
to determine the commission of the year that starts:

.. If the growth was equal to, or greater than *30%*,
the PARTNER will receive a commission of *30%*.

.. Otherwise, the commission will be of *15%*.

. If the PARTNER wishes to add more value to the CUSTOMER on their own accord,
the commission can be higher, with previous mutual agreement of:
added value that will be given by the PARTNER, minimum and desired final price,
and commision percentage for the PARTNER
(higher than *30%*).

.. This option is also susceptible to the *15* percentual points
reduction in the comission
(*50%* of the minimum *30%*) if there is no yearly growth.

. +Fluid Attacks+ will bill the end CUSTOMER
and collect the payment from the USA, through an automatic recurring system
on the Internet which requires credit card.

.. In any other situation, or at the PARTNER's will,
the PARTNER will be in charge of billing and collection.
Any risk or delay derived from the non-payment of the end CUSTOMER
will not be transfered to +Fluid Attacks+.

. +Fluid Attacks+ will start the service *1 day* after receiving the payment
regarding configuration and first month of service.

.. From the second month of service and on, the CUSTOMER or the PARTNER
has a grace period of *15 days* without payment
before the service is suspended.

. All services will be provided remotely.

. In case the +Fluid Attacks+ employee needs to travel:

.. +Fluid Attacks+ will pay for the time and air tickets.

.. The PARTNER must cover every additional expense that is required.

. +Fluid Attacks+ does not sign exclusivity with any PARTNER.

. The PARTNER must sign a confidentiality and non-solicitation agreement.

. Each party is responsible for paying their respective taxes
based on the USA tax legislation.

. The PARTNER is obliged to inform in advance
about the potential CUSTOMERS where +Fluid Attacks+ professional services
will be presented.

. If +Fluid Attacks+ bills the end CUSTOMER in Latin America,
the contractual relationship between the PARTNER and +Fluid Attacks+
will be carried out through a Letter of Attorney

. +Fluid Attacks+ will not approach  the prospects
that the PARTNER has nominated for sales
if the PARTNER provides evidence of sales progress
every *30 days* or less.

. The PARTNER will collect every +25+ day of each month.
The PARTNER will consolidate all the payments made before
that day and proceeds to make the payment.

. +Fluid Attacks+ will collect every +25+ day of each month.
+Fluid Attacks+ will consolidate all the payments made before
that day and proceeds to make the payment.

. This agreement is reciprocal in its entirety, which means that
the same clauses apply if +Fluid Attacks+ successfully sells the PARTNER.
