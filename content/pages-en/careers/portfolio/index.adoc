= Portfolio

Regarding the portfolio,
we are in the process of creating a document that
best fits with what is described here.
This deliverable is imperative for our selection process.

We pretend that the candidate can present
their best academic and/or professional achievements
in this document.

We remind you that
the objectives of the portfolio are:

* Evidence the candidates capacity
to achieve concrete and outstanding results.
* Demonstrate the candidates interest in joining the company.
* See the alignment between the results expected by the company and
the results the candidate can achieve.

Here are the requirements for the document:

. The portfolio must be delivered in a PDF format
through the application form.
However, in this case you can build it and
send it in an email at careers@autonomicmind.co
. This document is different from your CV.
. The portfolio must have at least 5 achievements
Between personal, professional and academic.
Each one must be explained in at most 1 page.
* Designs/Diagrams (network, data, class, circuits, etc).
* Code examples.
* Documentation.

. The portfolio can present achievements in different categories
(source code, designs, documentation, etc).
. The portfolio must respect copyrights:
* Quoting relevant sources.
* Hiding the relation between the result and
the organization it was created for.
* Reproducing only part of the achievement
in order to prevent itâ€™s inadequate use.
. The portfolio may follow the guidelines for design portfolios
that apply to simple engineering assignments:
* Simple
* Interesting
* Easy to read
* Only your best results

The purpose of this document
is to assess your ability to express yourself,

little interest in the +FLUIDAttacks+ process and
for this reason the process will be terminated immediately.
