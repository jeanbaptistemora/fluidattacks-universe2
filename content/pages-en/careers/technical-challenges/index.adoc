= Technical Challenges

This stage is parallel to the other stages of the process and
therefore, the more progress you make on it now,
the greater the probability is
of being evaluated before the other participants
once the other stages finish.

It can also be considered as a kind of lifesaver in the process,
because you may not have graduated yet,
have no previous work experience,
or get a low score on your knowledge test,
but if you able to successfully finish this stage,
you will show that you have the most valuable competence of all:
The ability to learn new things on the fly and
apply them to solve real problems.
This, along with human warmth and strong [button]#link:../../values[values]#,
have more weight than everything else.

== 1. Philosophy

In this stage, we want you to evidence your technical skills
through practical exercises and problems
similar to the ones you will face in +Fluid Attacks+.

The technical challenges are divided into
+vbd-hacking+, +ctf-hacking+ and programming challenges.
With the former, you demonstrate your skill to surpass security controls.
With the second one, you demonstrate your adaptation skills
when it comes to solving problems in unknown environments.
With the latter, you show that you are able
to quickly understand source code,
and thus it will be easier for you to audit it.

By uploading solutions to the repositories,
we look forward to:

. Promote the solution of unresolved challenges.

. Encourage self-directed and independent learning

. Bring to life the solutions financed by +Fluid Attacks+.

. Allow third parties to view the deliverables of our team.

The collateral effects of this decision allow +Fluid Attacks+ to:

. Use the +GitLab+ infrastructure to analyze
the quality and speed of the development of everyone in the process.

. From early stages,
familiarize potential talents with the tools
(+Git+, +AsciiDoc+, +Python+, +Gherkin+, etc) and
concepts (automation, unit tests, continuous integration, +linting+, etc.) that
they will use in their daily work in +Fluid Attacks+.

. Make the results visible to the community and
the team (peer pressure).

== 2. Objectives

. Solve +3+ unique programming challenges.

. Solve +3+ unique +ctf-hacking+ challenges.

. Solve +3+ unique +vbd-hacking+ challenges.

== 3. Criteria

Challenge solutions,
regardless if they are programming, +ctf-hacking+ or +vbd-hacking+
must always meet the following [button]#link:../../style/#font[style]# guideline.

Programming solutions must additionally comply with the following:

. A solution in the same language you chose (in the challenge folder)
must not exist already.

. They must not have an external indexed solution
(links + OTHERS.lst + of the challenge) for the language chosen by you.

. The execution commands used and
their output must be included in the *postlude*
at the end of the code.
+
.milogin.rs
[source, rust, linenums]
----
My solution's last line.

/*
$ ./skhorn
over obese obese normal obese obese obese obese ...
*/
----

. If the solution takes a set of input data,
such input must not be hardcoded into the solution.
Meaning that the solution must read from a +DATA.lst+ file
located in the challenge directory.
If such file does not exist, you must include it in your commit

+ctf-hacking+ and +vbd-hacking+ solutions must comply with the following:

. They must not have a solution in +Gherkin+ (+*.feature+)
in the repository (challenge folder).

. They must not have an external indexed solution
(links +OTHERS.lst+ of the challenge).

. They must be challenges that
require a technical level (not mathematical nor riddle)
from [button]#link:http://www.wechall.net/[WeChall]#
or its related sites.

Aditionally, +ctf-hacking+ solutions
must comply with the following:

. They must follow the template link:https://gitlab.com/autonomicmind/training/blob/master/templates/hacking-challenges.feature[hacking-challenges.feature]

Aditionally, +vbd-hacking+ solutions
must comply with the following:

. They must follow the template link:https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/writeups/blob/master/templates/hacking-systems.feature[hacking-systems.feature]

. They must be challenges that Require
exploiting intentionally vulnerable systems (+ToE+) listed in:
.. [button]#link:https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Vulnerable_Web_Applications_Directory_Project#Off-Line_apps[OWASP Off-Line apps]#
.. [button]#link:https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Vulnerable_Web_Applications_Directory_Project#Virtual_Machines_or_ISOs[OWASP VMs / ISOs]#
.. [button]#link:https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Vulnerable_Web_Applications_Directory_Project#On-Line_apps[OWASP On-Line apps]#
.. [button]#link:https://www.vulnhub.com/[Vulnhub]#
. All source code in solutions must follow the parameters described in
[button]#link:../../style/#font[this guide]#


== 4. Score

As you go on solving programming or +ctf-hacking+ challenges,
you must report your +total score+, +ranking+ and
+score+ obtained for the specific challenged solved,
which will allow us to follow your progress in this stage.
All this information must be included in the +commit message+
following the format described in the link:#envio[submission requirements]

Here's how to get your scores and ranking for each platform.

=== 4.1 Programming

. World Ranking

.. In +codeabbey+, go to the “Ranking” tab:
image:ranking-mundial-codeabbey.png[World Ranking - codeabbey]

.. Scroll to the bottom of the page and
there you will find your position in the world ranking:
image:ranking-mundial-codeabbey-2.png[World Ranking - codeabbey]

. Country Ranking

.. While in the “Ranking” rab,
select the country:
image:ranking-colombia-codeabbey.png[Country Ranking]

.. The page doesn’t directly show your position
so you will have to manually count.
To make this easier,
you should take into account that each page shows +50+ users.

You must continue to the next page
until you find your username on the ranking board
image:ranking-colombia-codeabbey-2.png[Country Ranking - codeabbey]

=== 4.2 CTF-Hacking

image::ranking-wechall.png[Wechall Ranking]

=== 4.3 Rankings

There is a site for both training and wirteups statistics
that will allow you to know things like
how many unique solutions you have uploaded,
your position in the overall hacker ranking,
most used programming languages,
among many others.
You can access the site [button]#link:https://autonomicmind.gitlab.io/training/[here]#

== 5. Submission

Solutions are sent through a +Merge Request+ (+MR+)
to the +master+ branch of the repositories:

. [button]#link:https://gitlab.com/autonomicmind/training/merge_requests?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=merged[training]# for +ctf-hacking+ and programming challenges
. [button]#link:https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/writeups/merge_requests?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=merged[writeups]# for +vbd-hacking+ challenges

Before sending an +MR+
please verify that you meet the following criteria:

. You should only work on a branch
whose name is exactly your username in +Gitlab+.

. All files related to a challenge’s solution
must respect the [button]#link:#structure[following structure]#

. If the solutions require additional files,
they must be included in the corresponding challenge directory.

. Each challenge solution must be submitted
with +10+ link:#external[external solutions] (+10+ +URLs+ in +OTHERS.lst+ files).

. The solution and all files associated to it
must be all sent in +1+ +commit+.

. The +commit+ for each solution must be sent in only +1+ +MR+.

. The +MR+ must only be sent
once your branch has successfully finished integrating (green).

. If the +MR+ is rejected it must not be reopened.
The errors must be fixed and the solution sent in a new +MR+.

. The +commit+ message to send the solution
must follow one of the templates
according to the type of the solution:

.. link:https://gitlab.com/autonomicmind/training/blob/master/templates/commit-msg-challenges.txt[Programming and ctf-hacking challenges]
.. link:https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/writeups/blob/master/templates/commit-msg-vbd.txt[vbd-hacking vulnerabilities].

== 6. External

The rules for the links (+URLs+)
to external solutions (+OTHERS.lst+) are the following:

. They must be direct links (+HTTP 200+) without redirection (+HTTP 301/302+).

. They don’t need to be solutions for the same challenge you solved.

. They must be +hacking+ links if you solved a +hacking+ challenge.

.. The links must be unique,
in other words, external solutions to challenges
to which we have no previous external solutions.

.. If you send a +vbd-hacking+ solution,
the external solutions must be +vbd-hacking+ solutions.

.. If you send a +ctf-hacking+ solution,
the external solutions can be +ctf-hacking+ or +vbd-hacking+ solutions.

. They must be programming solutions
if you solved a programming challenge.

.. You must not add external solutions
for a language that already has an external solution.

.. Within the +OTHERS+ of a programming solution
the +URLs+ must be ordered alphabetically by extension.

. If it is in +github+ the +URL+ must be to its +raw+ version
(link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[]).

== 7. Examples

Examples of +MR+ that have been accepted recently can be found here:

. [button]#link:https://gitlab.com/autonomicmind/training/merge_requests?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=merged[training]#

. [button]#link:https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/writeups/merge_requests?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=merged[writeups]#

== 8. Recommendations

. When solving programming challenges,
we suggest using a language that is not widely used.

. When solving +ctf-hacking+ challenges,
we recommend [button]#link:https://www.root-me.org/?lang=en[Root Me]#

. Submit your solution immediately after you solve the challenge.
Do not accumulate solutions on your computer without sending them,
because this way,
you will never receive feedback
in order to know what you are doing wrong

== 9. Repositories

It is ideal that you become familiar with the versioning and
the structure that we detail below.

=== 9.1 Structure

Solutions are stored in the following folders
depending on the repository you are currently in:

[role="tb-col"]
[frame="topbot"]
|====
^.^s| Repo ^.^| training ^.^| training ^.^| writeups

|====

The naming of all files and folders,
must not exceed +35+ characters,
written in lowercase,
without any special characters and
In case a space is needed use a *-* (dash) to replace it.

=== 9.2 Files

Some of the folders described in the structure contain special files:

** *LINK.lst:* Contains the challenge URL.
(link:https://gitlab.com/autonomicmind/training/blob/master/challenges/codeabbey/001/LINK.lst[example]).
This file must only have one line with the challenge link and
it must give a +HTTP 200+ response when visiting it (No redirection).

** *DATA.lst:* Contains the test cases
with which the challenge was validated.
This file should only contain test cases that are
immediately processable by any solution file.

** *OTHERS.lst:* It contains the links to the external solutions
found on the Internet for said challenge
which must not be read or used
as a reference to solve the challenge.
This file allows an automatic script to perform a similarity analysis
with the challenges sent by the candidates.
They must comply with what is specified [button]#link:#external[here]#

** *SPEC.txt* and *spec.yml*:
Contains the specifications of challenges site or
the vulnerable machine you are working on,
like number of challenges or vulnerabilities, +URL+ and difficulty.
You can see an example link:https://gitlab.com/autonomicmind/training/blob/master/systems/bwapp/SPEC.txt[here]

== 10. Stage steps

== 11. End

The challenge stage ends under any of the following conditions:

. You have met all link:#objectives[objectives] and
Sent an +email+ with the links to your solutions in the +master+ branch.
. If there is no activity (+push+ to the +git+ repos) in +14+ calendar days.
. If you reach the maximum of +10+ failed +MR+,
this means the +MR+ was rejected and
not merged due to its failure to meet the requirements.
. If you explicitly manifest your desire to end the process in an +email+.
. If you present someone else’s complete or
partial solutions as your own (plagiarism).
. If you solve a challenge with the help of others.

In all cases, the email address for these steps is: careers@autonomicmind.co

If you were removed from the process due to any of these circumstances,
except for the last two,
You may apply again at any time
and start over the process by clicking
[button]#link:../../../../forms/aplicacion[here]#

== 12. Builds

It is possible to run local integrations
in order to identify any errors before doing +push+ or
sending a +merge requests+ to the repositories.
To do so,
please read the instrcutions provided [button]#link:https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/writeups/wikis/Local-builds[here]#.

== 13. Commit syntax and Commitlint

At +Fluid Attacks+ we use a specific syntax for commits and MR's,
this with the purpose of doing data analysis.
All commit and MR messages will be evaluated by the continuous integrator (CI).
More information about such syntax can be found link:https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/default/wikis/Commit-and-MR-Messages[here].

Commitlint is a tool that allows to verify
if a commit or MR message is compliant with the defined syntax rules.
Commitlint can be run locally with the purpose of speeding up checks.
More information about Commitlint can be found link:https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/default/wikis/Commit-and-MR-Messages#local-commitlint-setup[here].

== 14. Questions

* Before you send us a question,
please read this document carefully once more and
our link:../faq/[Frequently Asked Questions].

* You can tell us your doubts and
questions in our *#general*

== 16. Plagirism

Having the solutions available at everyones disposal
poses an opportunity for plagiarism,
How do we show the solutions to the world and avoid plagiarism?
Plagiarism is not a technical problem,
It is a moral problem of presenting someone else’s work
as your own.

To avoid plagiarism we seek visibility and
an explicit declaration of the authorship of each algorithm
in a centralized place.
This provides clear evidence of the attribution of authorship and
allows for public scrutiny in case of plagiarism.

In other words, the current model avoids plagiarism
through total transparency.

+Fluid Attacks+ actively applies algorithmic similarity detection techniques
on all solutions submitted.
In particular using:
