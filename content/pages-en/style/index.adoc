= Style

The goal of +Fluid Attacks+ blog
is to share opinions and knowledge
on information security issues
in a clear and understandable manner.

[quote]
We invite you to share your knowledge with us and the world.

The target audience is people
who don’t have an advanced technical knowledge.
You must use simple language but
provide relevant knowledge on security issues.

== Topics

The blog topics are oriented
only towards security and +IT+,
however, there are situations that are not necessarily security related but
can be treated as such:

1. How to explain to a Manager
that they must invest in security.

2. How to use a specific component:
You can explain the secure way to use and implement it.

3. Explain a concept by solving a +hacking+ challenge.

You can also check our link:../topics/[list of topics].

. *First section:* An introduction that tells the reader
what he/she can expect.

that tells the reader the overall topic.

=== 5. Semantic Line Breaks

Documents must have Semantic Line Breaks
(link:http://sembr.org/[SLB]),
in order to facilitate editing and
keep an organized record of modifications
in our version control system (+Gitlab+).
To do this, we define the following rules:

. Minimum words before a SLB: 4.
. Maximum number of characters before a SLB: 80.
. A SLB *must* be added after a period (.).
. A SLB *can* be added after
link:https://emedia.rmit.edu.au/learninglab/content/common-linking-words-0[linking  words and connectors], depending on the context and
respecting the previous rules.

Exceptions to the rule are:

. Links.
. Source Code.

*Example:*

.Example SLB.
