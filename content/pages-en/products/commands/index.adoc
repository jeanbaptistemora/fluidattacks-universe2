= Commands

Trojan developed completely by +FLUIDAttacks+ 
to penetrate in depth work stations 
and critical servers during the One Shot Hacking service. 
The goal is to take full control of critical equipment 
and through a central command center 
coordinate more complex hacks in depth. 
+FLUIDCommands+ allows to capture sound, screen, keyboard, 
files, network traffic, among others. 
During the attack, it avoids being detected 
by +AntiX+ and +SOC+ controls 
and at the end of the test it is uninstalled 
without leaving any collateral effect.
