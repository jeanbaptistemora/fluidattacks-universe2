= Commands

Cyberweapon developed completely by +FLUIDAttacks+
for in depth penetration of work stations and critical servers
during the Pentests where its use is authorized.

== Purpose

We are not only interested in finding a vulnerability
but also showing the client the pottential risks it implies
and the direct impact it has on the business.
To do this, we look to take full control of multiple critical systems
in order to create a network of infected nodes
and be able to control them
to obtain sensitive information or further infect other nodes.

== How we do it

In order to be able to use +FLUIDCommands+
we first need administrative access to the vulnerable system,
this we achieve through the manual tests that our experts execute.
Once administrative access is obtained
we can proceed to remotely infect the machine.
With the first machine compromised and under our control
we can now expand and infect other connected nodes
or focus on the machine at hand
and do an in-depth search in look of sensitive information
or new and bigger attack vectors.
It is important to note that the commands cyberweapon
is never installed on the vulnerable system as a service
nor an automatic running task.
Once all tests have concluded
it is remotely uninstalled
without any collateral damage.

== Command and Control Center

+FLUIDCommands+ counts with a Command and Control Center
from which we can send orders/commands to our botnet of infected nodes.
The Command and Control Center communicates with all infected nodes
through a reverse proxy using ICMP
giving us always have full control over our cyberweapon.
Having only one node infected,
commands can remotely spread to neighbouring systems.

|====
a|=== src command

Through the scr command we can take a screen capture of the infected machine
without alerting the victim.

a|=== exec command

This allows us to remotely execute any command available through cmd on the infected machine.

a|=== echo command

This command is used to test the connection and assure we have control of the infected node.
It echos back whatever we pass to it.

== Detection Evasion

Our cyberweapon avoids being detected
by all +AntiX+ and +SOC+ controls
by masking all requests and commands
under a familiar and trusted protocol.
