= Rules

FLUIDRules is a set of security requirements 
that allow you to parameterize a hack 
according to the risk appetite of each organization. 
FLUIDRules allows you to determine what is tested and what is not, 
what is a vulnerability and what is not, 
additionally, it is the basis to determine how rigorous a hack was 
based on proven and unproven requirements. 
The security requirements are independent of the technology type 
and are written as specific and understandable objectives. 
In some way are the commandments that you agree to comply 
and therefore in our hacking services we determine if these are met or not.
