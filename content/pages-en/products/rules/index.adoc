= Rules

FLUIDRules is a set of security requirements
that allow you to parameterize a pentest
according to the risk appetite of each organization.
FLUIDRules allows you to determine what will be tested and what won't,
what is a vulnerability and what is not.
In addition to this,
it is also the basis to determine how rigorous a pentest was
based on tested and untested requirements.
The security requirements are independent of the type of technology being used
and are written as specific and understandable objectives.
In a way they are the security commandments that you agree to follow and comply with
and therefore, in our hacking services, we determine if these are met or not.
