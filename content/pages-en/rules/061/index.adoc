= REQ.061 Document security chapter

== Requirement

The documentation that supports an information system
must contain a security chapter.

== Description

The system documentation must sustain the design and usage
of the defined security features.

== Implementation

. The security of the information
is a non-functional feature of the systems,
the documentation thereof must support the previously established definitions
in order to protect the information handled by the system.

. The design documentation should include the designed abuse cases,
the necessary security requirements
to protect the information and the design of established controls.
This documentation helps in the validation of security implementation.

. In the user documentation, the configuration and use of controls
that each user profile can apply should be detailed step by step.

== Attacks

. The design documents did not establish the abuse-cases
and security requirements that the application needs
and therefore the necessary controls
for information protections were not implemented.

. The security configuration parameters were not documented,
users do not use the defined security controls.

== Attributes

* Layer: Business Layer.
* Asset: Security Architecture
* Scope: Maintainability.
* Phase: Operation.
* Type of Control: Recommendation.
