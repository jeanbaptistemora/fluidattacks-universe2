= REQ.023 Close inactive users sessions

== Requirement

The system must close a session if there is a period of inactivity
on the user side, greater than or equal to +5+ minutes.

== Description

A system that has authentication and login
can keep it open for an indefinite period
if there is no automatic control of session closure
and the user does not close it manually.

Failure to control the closing times may allow an attacker
to take advantage of unattended sessions and execute actions
on behalf of the authenticated user without their authorization,
altering confidential information associated with accounts,
this risk can increase its criticality notably
if the system allows the entry to administrators with high privileges,
since it would affect the integrity,
confidentiality and availability of the system,
its users and the information it contains.

== Implementation

Set the session times: Depending on the business needs
and/or the company's session management policies,
end times of unattended sessions must be set at a prudential time
(recommended of +5+ minutes).

== Attacks

. An employed or anonymous user takes control of an account
unattended by another user without their authorization. <<r1, ^[1]^>> <<r2, ^[2]^>>

. In a web server, having several open sessions during a long period
force the server to consume a lot of memory
by deploying and maintaining session objects.

== Attributes

* Layer: Resource Layer.

* Asset: Session Management.

* Scope: Adherence.

* Phase: Operation.

* Type of Control: Procedure.
