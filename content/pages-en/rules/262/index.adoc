= REQ.262 Verify third-party components

== Requirement

The components provided by third-parties
must be implemented in stable, tested and updated versions.

== Description

. The organization must ensure that all its products
and the products provided by third-parties
are up to date to the latest stable and tested version,
reducing the risk of exploiting vulnerabilities
reported in previous versions.

. When a product changes its version,
the implemented improvements must be checked
to verify if there were fixes or new controls
related to recently discovered vulnerabilities.

== Implementation

. Identify all the products that compose the technology stack,
including operating systems, versions, dependencies,
logical and physical authentication, features and person in charge.
This inventory must be kept updated.

. Monitor the security of all identified components in public databases,
implementing alerts when public vulnerabilities are disclosed
in the products used by the organization
and determining the affectation level
caused by the reported vulnerability.

. Apply the necessary updates taking into account the vulnerability type,
the affected components,
and the risk classification within the organization.

. Define security policies for the used components,
requiring updated versions, specific software,
ethical hacking and product licenses;
include internal policies  to disable unused features
and update default settings
that may pose a risk to the organization.

== Attacks

. An attacker obtains technical information about a specific product.
If the service/software is out of date,
there could be public exploits <<r1, ^[1]^>>
designed to attack known vulnerabilities
present in previous versions of the product.

== Attributes

. Layer: Application layer.
. Asset: Services and functions.
. Scope: Stability.
. Phase: Operation.
. Type of Control: Recommendation.
