= REQ.224 Use secure cryptographic mechanisms

== Requirement

System must use the most secure cryptographic mechanism
provided by the platform (e.g +java.security.SecureRandom+)
for random number generation used in critical processes
(e.g +ID generation, code mapping, cryptographic keys+)

There is an explicit policy for how cryptographic keys (if any) are managed,
and the lifecycle of cryptographic keys is enforced.
Ideally, follow a key management standard such as +NIST SP 800-57+.

Verify that all random numbers, random file names, random GUIDs,
and random strings are generated using the cryptographic moduleâ€™s
approved random number generator
when these random values are intended to be not guessable by an attacker.
