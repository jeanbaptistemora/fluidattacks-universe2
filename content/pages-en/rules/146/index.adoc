There is an explicit policy for how cryptographic keys (if any) are managed,
and the lifecycle of cryptographic keys is enforced.
Ideally, follow a key management standard such as +NIST SP 800-57+.

Verify that there is an explicit policy
for how cryptographic keys are managed
(e.g., generated, distributed, revoked, and expired).
Verify that this key lifecycle is properly enforced.

Verify that sensitive passwords or key material maintained in memory
is overwritten with zeros as soon as it no longer required,
to mitigate memory dumping attacks.

Verify that authenticated data is cleared from client storage,
such as the browser DOM, after the client or session is terminated.
