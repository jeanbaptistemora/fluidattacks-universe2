= REQ.141 Force re authentication

== Requirement

System must force users to re authenticate
or invalidate the system session
once changed the user state
(password changing/recovery, lockouts, user deletion, etc)

== References

Verify that sensitive operations
(e.g. change password, change email address, add new biller, etc.)
require re-authentication (e.g. password or 2FA token).
This is in addition to CSRF measures, not instead.
