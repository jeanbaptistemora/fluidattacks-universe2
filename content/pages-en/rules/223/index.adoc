Verify that all random numbers, random file names, random GUIDs,
and random strings are generated using the cryptographic moduleâ€™s
approved random number generator
when these random values are intended to be not guessable by an attacker.

Verify that random numbers are created with proper entropy
even when the application is under heavy load,
or that the application degrades gracefully in such circumstances.
