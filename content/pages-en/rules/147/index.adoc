There is an explicit policy for how cryptographic keys (if any) are managed,
and the lifecycle of cryptographic keys is enforced.
Ideally, follow a key management standard such as +NIST SP 800-57+.

Verify that all random numbers, random file names, random GUIDs,
and random strings are generated using the cryptographic moduleâ€™s
approved random number generator
when these random values are intended to be not guessable by an attacker.

Verify that cryptographic algorithms used by the application
have been validated against FIPS 140-2 or an equivalent standard.
