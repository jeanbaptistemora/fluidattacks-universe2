= REQ.047 Classify critical files for monitoring

== Requirement

The critical files must be established for each system
in order to follow up its integrity.

== Description

Each system has files that are necessary for its operation
(master files, setting files, among others),
each one of these files must be identified
and tracked using tools that permanently monitor the activities
carried out on them.

== Implementation

Each system has a file structure
that contains information about its configuration and operation,
if these files are modified they can alter the execution of the system
and for this reason it is important to establish a permanent monitoring
of the integrity of these.
The monitoring should notify the system administrator
of the changes made immediately,
and enable a record of the activities carried out.

== Attacks

. An incident occurs in which a modification of critical files is identified,
however it was not possible to detect in advance
by not having a tool that registers the modifications
in the compromised files.

== Attributes

* Layer: Application Layer.

* Asset: Critical Files.

* Scope: Integrity.

* Phase: Operation.

* Type of Control: Recommendation.
