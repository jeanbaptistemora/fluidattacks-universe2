= A Journey to OSCE

Several days ago, I took the OSCE exam and passed it. It was the first time
that I've tried it and I completed all the exam tasks in 11 hours.

In this article, I will describe how was my experience and the methodology
I used that finally led to achieve the OSCE certification.

== Background

To start, I think it's fair to mention a little of my experience. I started
to get into hacking and security world during my college time, a good 20+
years ago.

The first article I read on exploitation was Aleph One's mythical
*Smashing The Stack For Fun And Profit*. It was around 1999 and by that time
I knew nothing about computers. The introduction of that article mentioned
unknown things like *Linux*, *C*, *Stack*, etc and it was the very first
trigger for me to get deep into the security world.
As you may guess, it took me several years to fully understand that article,
but I learned a *LOT* during the process. In fact, I wrote several tools
at that time to debug and reverse ELF files.

I also started making contributions to the Debian project, starting on 2003
maintaining a core package for Linux at that time:
link:https://salsa.debian.org/joowie-guest/maintain_lilo/-/blob/master/debian/changelog[LILO]
(the acestor of Grub).
With that, I became an official Debian maintainer and still hold that
position (aroldan <at> debian.org). I was very
active from 2003 to 2013 making contributions to the Debian project,
maintaining packages like
link:https://people.redhat.com/jakub/prelink/[Prelink] and
link:https://www.valgrind.org/[Valgrind], whose manpage I initially
link:https://linux.die.net/man/1/valgrind[wrote] (you can see my email in the
credits at the end). I also made the first Debian package for
link:https://metadata.ftp-master.debian.org/changelogs//main/h/hydra/hydra_9.1-1_changelog[Hydra] and packaged
link:https://github.com/thorkill/eresi[ERESI].

I've also been working full time in security-related tasks for over 18 years,
mostly focused on offensive security.

I've earned the CEH certification several times, the last one expired at 2012.
The same year, I made the PWK course (although at that time Kali was known as
Backtrack) and earned the OSCP certification.

The OSCE was the next step.

== CTP course

In May of 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, I started the Cracking The
Perimeter (CTP) course. You can see the public course syllabus
link:https://www.offensive-security.com/documentation/cracking-the-perimeter-syllabus.pdf[here].
I made no previous special preparation for the course, other than my
work experience.

The course modules are very well structured. Mati's clear explainations of
each technical detail shows his mastery on the topic.

While you are in the course, you have a one-month access to a Offsec lab
on where you can follow along with the modules content.

The way I approached the course was to watch the videos following the
written material. Then, at the end of each module, replicated the whole
exercise from the scratch, without peeping the course material and tried to
came up with the same result. Also, I developed and solved the extra mile
excercises.

It took me around one and a half week to complete to course.
However, I wanted to be able to understand and replicate the vulnerabilities
presented on the modules, all by myself. In the remaining lab time,
I re-did all the course modules, at least 3 times, from the scratch. Every
failure on getting the module objectives was an oportunity to learn new
things.

When the lab time was about to expire, I was able to set up my own test lab.
It was consisted of a Windows XP SP3 and a Windows Vista Business machines.

== Self-study

My lab time was scheduled to end the 8th of June and the OSCE exam was
scheduled on the 13th of July.

During that month I needed to practice what was learnt during the course. So
I used the following to sharpen the skills:

* On my local lab, I ran
link:https://github.com/stephenbradshaw/vulnserver[Vulnserver]. It is a
TCP server with several mock commands, some of them vulnerable on purpose and
each vulnerability has its own quirk. To be able to fully understand the
exploitation process of each affected command, I produced a series of
articles:
** link:../vulnserver-trun/[TRUN command exploitation]
** link:../vulnserver-gmon/[GMON command exploitation]
** link:../vulnserver-gter/[GTER command exploitation]
** link:../vulnserver-gter-no-egghunter/[GTER command exploitation without egghunter]
** link:../vulnserver-kstet/[KSTET command exploitation]
** link:../vulnserver-kstet-alternative/[KSTET command exploitation alternative]
** link:../vulnserver-lter-seh/[LTER command exploitation]
** link:../reversing-vulnserver/[Reversing vulnserver]
* I also looked for vulnerable applications with exploits and wrote a couple
of articles with some tricky exploitations:
** link:../quickzip-exploit/[QuickZip exploitation]
** link:../netscan-exploit/[MiTec Net Scanner exploitation]
* And finally wrote an article about backdooring and avoiding antivirus:
** link:../backdooring-putty/[Backdooring PuTTY]

Writing those articles helped me a lot to fully put together
what was taught in the course.

The web part of the course was practiced using
link:http://www.dvwa.co.uk/[DVWA] and link:http://www.itsecgames.com/[BWAPP]

In summary, my total preparation time, including the CTP course and self-study
was around 50 days, with an average daily time of study of 9 hours.

== Exam

The OSCE exam is a VPN network with several objetives to complete. The VPN
access is provided for 47h:45m and they give you another 24 hours
after the exam to send a detailed professional report with the findings and
objectives.

My exam was scheduled to start the 13th of July at 2PM COT. I was pretty
anxious about what was going to be presented in the exam. I read a lot of
reviews and almost everyone mentioned that the exam was "brutal", "made
by the devil", and the "hardest thing ever tried".
When I checked the exam objectives, I then realized that the course was
indeed a starting point and that further study of what was taught in the
CTP modules is extremely important in order to complete the exam.

With that in place, I decided to start with the lower points tasks. After
around 4 hours I had them resolved. It was about 6PM and I decided to take a
short rest to eat. After around 30 minutes, I started with one of the
higher points tasks and fully complete it after around 3 hours.
It was almost 10PM and I was a bit exhausted. I was trying to figure out
the other higher point task but I couldn't get a way to even start. I then
took a rest and watched TV to switch brain context. At around 11PM I got
an idea of how to approach the final task. I started working on my idea,
not believing that it would work, but it did. At around 1AM the final task
was completed.

I couldn't almost sleep that night because of the joy of being achieved all
the exam points. The next morning I started writing the exam report. As I
had plenty of time, I could get additional screenshots for the report.
At around 5PM of that day I had it completed. It was a 79 page report.
I re-checked it several times, following the
link:https://support.offensive-security.com/osce-exam-guide/[exam guide]
and finally submitted it to Offsec.

I got the response a couple of days later saying that I had successfully
completed the exam and earned OSCE!

== Conclusion

That was my OSCE journey. I can only advice to take the time to expand
to what is taught on the course, because on real world, every application
will have it's own tricks to be exploited and you won't have a teacher next
to you. Also, in my case, writing articles greatly helped me to consolidate
what I've learnt. But as always, you milliage may vary.
