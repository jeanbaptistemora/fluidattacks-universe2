:description: In terms of market share, Android is the king of kings, having more than 80% of the total smartphone owner share. Hence, it is also the most suitable target for hackers. Here we are going to show how to intercept Android applications' web traffic by installing a self-signed certificate.

= Intercepting Android

+Android+ is an operating system
based on the +Linux+ kernel and used by mobile devices
such as smartphones and tablets.
Due to its popularity, it is the major target for hackers.
One of their common techniques is to intercept
and try to break an app's web traffic
using attack methods like fuzzing and brute force.

Mobile applications usually share
the same communication structure as web applications,
meaning that we can intercept requests by using a proxy.
If an application is using a secure channel like HTTPS,
we are going to have to install a digital certificate
into the phone in order to make it
accept our proxied requests.

Since Android 7 Nougat (link:https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/07/changes-to-trusted-certificate.html[API >= 24])
we can no longer use the simple method of setting our proxy
and the certificate to capture +HTTPS+ traffic
as the +Burpsuite+ page explains link:https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/articles/1841102-installing-burp-s-ca-certificate-in-an-android-device[here].
If we try this method,
we will receive thousands of certificate failures from our proxy.
This is because the Android operating system
no longer trusts certificates installed by the user.

To solve this we need to have a rooted +Android+ smartphone,
then create and sign a digital certificate,
and finally put it in the system's certificate folder in our phone.

In order to intercept the application’s traffic
we are going to need some tools.
The tools that we are going to use are:

* link:https://www.openssl.org/source/[OpenSSL]
* link:https://developer.android.com/studio[Android Studio]


== Creating the certificate

So what is a +TLS CA certificate+?
When you communicate with a third party
using a secure channel like +HTTPS+,
the +SSL+ (Secure Socket Layer) protocol
and the +TLS+ (Transport Layer Security) protocol
include a security measure called digital certificates
that implements asymmetric encryption
by using a private and public key.

In this protocol, a public key is signed
by the +CA+ (Certificate Authority) using their private key.
This way a certificate provides a link
between the public key and the +CA+ that signed that key.
The following process is how a connection works:

. The browser connects to the server using a secure protocol.
. The server responds with the digital certificate
containing the server's public key.
. The browser looks to see if the +CA+ from the certificate is included
on its trusted list of +CA's+.
This is where we will work.
. Once the browser verifies that the +CA+ from the certificate
is in its trusted list of +CA's+,
it uses the public key provided in +(2)+
to create a session key.
. Finally, the browser and the server encrypt data
over the connection using the session key.

Having a +CA-issued+ digital certificate
with its public keys stored on the trusted list
indicates to a cellphone
that it can _"trust"_ the proxy +HTTPS+ responses.
Without this, we cannot intercept secure channel traffic.
As we don’t have a +CA+
we are going to create a self-signed one.

First, we generate the certificate
with 3650 days of validity
and using a +SHA256+ hash.
It will also request some information.
We can put our personal/company information here
or leave it blank:

.Generating the certificate
[source, bash]
----
$ openssl req -x509 -days 3650 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -outform der -keyout fluidattacks.key -out fluidattacks.der -extensions v3_ca
Generating a RSA private key

writing new private key to 'fluidattacks.key'

You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.

Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:CO
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Antioquia
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Medellin
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Fluid Attacks
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Fluid Attacks
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:Fluid Attacks
Email Address []:continuous@fluidattacks.com
----

After generating the certificate,
we have to convert it to +PEM+
in order to import it into the phone,
and +DER+ to import it into +burp+:

.Converting the cert
[source, bash]
----
$ openssl x509 -inform DER -outform PEM -text -in fluidattacks.der -out fluidattacks.pem
$ openssl rsa -in fluidattacks.key -inform pem -out fluidattacks.key.der -outform der
----

Finally, we export our key into a +PKCS8+ file
in order to import it to +burp+:

.Modifying for burp
[source, bash]
----
$ openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -in fluidattacks.key.der -inform der -out fluidattacks.key.pkcs8.der -outform der -nocrypt
----

Once we have all the files,
we need to start configuring our phones.

== Configuring Android

The certificates installed on the phone
follow the name +HASH.0+;
so we need the hash of the certificate:

.Getting the hash
[source, bash]
----
$ openssl x509 -inform PEM -subject_hash -in fluidattacks.pem | head -1
----

After getting the hash,
we create a copy of the certificate
with that hash in the name.
For example, something like +49ef1764.0+:

.Renaming for Android
[source, bash]
----
$ cp fluidattacks.pem <HASH>.0
----

Then, we need to upload our certificate to the phone.
We can do it manually by connecting the phone
and moving the file into a folder
or with the following command using +adb+:

.Uploading the cert
[source, bash]
----
$ adb push <HASH>.0 /data/local/tmp
----

Once the file is in the phone,
log in as +root+,
remount the folder +/system+ with read and write permissions
(it is not mounted with those permissions by default),
copy our certificate to the +/system/etc/security/cacerts/+ folder
and change its permissions and ownership to +644+ and +root:root:+

.Setting the cert
[source, bash, linenums]
----
$ adb shell
phone$ su
phone# mount -o rw,remount /system
phone# mv /data/local/tmp/<HASH>.0 /system/etc/security/cacerts/
phone# chmod 644 /system/etc/security/cacerts/<HASH>.0
phone# chown root:root /system/etc/security/cacerts/<HASH>.0
----

The last thing left to do
is to restart our phone to load our changes:

.Restarting
[source, bash]
----
phone# reboot
----

Once we turn the phone back on,
our certificate will be installed
on the system’s trusted credentials tab
and the phone will accept the responses of our proxy.

== Configuring the Proxy

Now we need to set our proxy in order to use our certificate.
Open +Burpsuite+ and create a new project.
Then move to the +Proxy+ tab
and open the +Options+ tab.

.Burp options

The next step is to import our certificate
by clicking on +Import / export CA certificate+,
then selecting +Certificate+ and private key in +DER+ format,
and choosing our +fluidattacks.der+
and +fluidattacks.key.pkcs8.der+ files
that we previously created.

.Import DER
image::import-der.png[Import DER]

.Choose file
image::cert-file.png[Choose file]

Now, we need to set our proxy in our phones.
Go to +WiFi+ settings,
select a shared connection
between the phone and the computer;
we can use the same network
that our computer is connected to
or use our computer as a mobile hotspot
to share it with our phone.
Then, expand the +Advanced options+,
set the +Proxy+ to +Manual+
and input the +IP+ address and proxy's port.

.Android Proxy
image::android-proxy.png[Android Proxy]

We are now capturing secure channel requests
made from our phone applications and browsers
without having problems with certificate failures.

If we want to have less default traffic on our proxy,
we can again modify the +WiFi+ settings of our phones
and fill-in the +Bypass proxy+ input
with the following domains:

.Default traffic sites
[source, bash]
----
*.google.com
*.googleapis.com
*.gstatic.com
