:description: This blog provides a brief description of static and dynamic taint analysis or taint checking. Essentially, you can't let unsanitized user input from a source arrive at a security-critical sink without passing through sanitization. Taint checkers make sure that happens.

= Tainted love

In several past articles,
we have briefly touched on the concept of taint analysis.
In this article,
we will fill in the knowledge gaps
regarding taint analysis which may have resulted
from our previous references.
On one hand, this concept is intimately linked
with code representations used by
some of the +ML+-powered vulnerability detectors
we have presented before,
and on the other hand,
it is well-complemented by symbolic execution,
so we deemed it necessary to clarify this concept a bit.

Most of the +OWASP+ top 10
web application vulnerabilites
arise because an attacker
can inject some code into
the application's inputs
which are then used to perform some action in the server.
The classic example for this is the +SQL+ injection.

For example, this page from +bWAPP+
has an input where the user is supposed to write a movie name,
which should contain only alphanumeric characters:

.bWAPP movie search
image::../fuzzy-bugs-online/scr-bwapp-movie-search.png[bWAPP movie search]

Some movies will occasionally have
punctuation marks such as a dash or a question mark.
Here is what this page does with the user input:

.Adapted from link:https://github.com/theand-fork/bwapp-code/blob/master/bWAPP/sqli_6.php[bWAPP code]
[source,php]
----
$title = $_POST["title"];
$sql = "SELECT * FROM movies WHERE title LIKE '%" . $title . "%'";
$recordset = mysql_query($sql, $link);
----

The input is taken from the +POST+ request
and pasted right into a +SQL+ query
which is immediately performed
and shown to the user in a table.
If instead of an actual movie name,
an attacker writes this in the box:

[source,sql]
----
%' UNION SELECT id, login, password, email, secret,
activated, admin FROM users;#
----

Then the +SQL+ query becomes this:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE title LIKE '%%'
  UNION SELECT id, login, password, email, secret,
  activated, admin FROM users;
----

And all the movies' information is retrieved,
along with the users' login information:

.Tainted!
image::../fuzzy-bugs-online/scr-succesful-sqli.png[bWAPP SQLi]

The user input has become _tainted_,
and hence the +SQL+ query is now taintedas well.
In the context of taint checking
the +$title+ input above is called a _source_,
which is where the bad input and
the possible injection is coming from.

What is the problem with tainted inputs?
it depends on what is done with them,
i.e., at the _sink_, where the input is consumed.
As we have stated in
past articles illustrating other injection- or _taint-style_,
this can be avoided with input validation
and sanitization. So basically,
simply check that the input is valid and fix it
if it's not by removing dangerous characters
or only allowing known good ones.

_Taint analysis_ or _taint checking_ consists
of identifying all sources of
potentially dangerous user input,
all security-critical sinks
such as system calls,
process interactions,
invoking shells,
altering files, etc,
and figure out if there is any sanitizers
between each source-sink pair:

Then, depending on whether this taint analysis
is _static_ (code) or _dynamic (runtime),
the taint-checking tool should either
report to the developer so they can fix the issues or
avoid the execution of security-critical operations
at the sink level based on data that has been tainted,
respectively.

== Dynamic taint analysis: the Perl approach

The `Perl` programming language is well-known
for having used taint analysis as early as 1989.
It is one of its main built-in security features,
as can be seen by browsing
link:https://perldoc.perl.org/perlsec.html[perlsec].

The `Perl` approach to taint checking is simple:

* Treat every input as tainted.

[source,perl]
----
my $name = $cgi->param("name");  # Get the $name from user input, tainted!
----

* Any line of code that contains a tainted variable
  implies that any assigned variables in that line
  are also tainted.

[source,perl]
----
my $full = $name."@fluidattacks.com";  # Now $full is also tainted
----

* A tainted variable can only be untainted
by _laundering it via regular expressions:

[source,perl]
----
if ($full =~ /^([-\@\w.]+)$/) {
    $full = $1;                    # $full now untainted
}
----

* No tainted variable can be used
  in any risky command, such as
  invoking a sub-shell, opening files,
  interacting with system processes, etc.
  That's the real run-time protection.
  Thus the following SQL +query+ would fail:

[source,perl]
----
$dbh->execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '$full';");
----

All a user needs to do
to enable taint mode in +Perl+ is
add the +-T+ switch when running from the command line
or in the case of executable scripts,
such as +CGI+ scripts (a common use case for +Perl+),
add that switch to the +shebang+:

[source,perl]
----
#!/usr/bin/perl -T
----

It is worth noting that,
since +Perl+ is an interpreted scripting language,
this taint mode is only a run-time protection
which might not be bulletproof and also
might block legitimate requests.

== Static analysis: the PyT approach

+PyT+ is a static taint-checking tool for
detecting security vulnerabilities in
+Python+ web applications.
More specifically, it was designed with +Flask+
applications in mind.
It was developed as a Master's thesis project
by Stefan Micheelsen and Bruno Thalman
at Aalborg University.

We chose this as an example of static taint
checking not for its results, but rather for the very well-written
and easy to understand thesis that explains PyT inner workings
and hence, the theory behind static taint analysis.
Regarding the actual results component, I got 0 vulnerabilities
in our own projects when using this tool and,
curiously in the tiny but bug-ridden
link:https://github.com/stamparm/DSVW[Damn Small Vulnerable Web]
application as well.

As you might now expect,
taint analysis is linked to the flow of information
inside the program,
which can be more accurately represented by the
program's _Control Flow Graph_.
They use as basis for a mathematical model
known as a _lattice_, which has an interesting property,
all monotone (steadily increasing or decreasing)
functions defined on them have a fixed point,
they eventually stand still.
As it happens, code reachability and data flow
can be represented in terms of equations on
this lattice.
These are _guaranteed_ to have a solution
by the fixed point property above.
Here is a more friendly depiction of the process,
in the author's own drawings:

The final step, of course,
is reporting, so that the developer might
take the appropriate measures to fix the taint vulnerabilities.

''''

The idea in both incarnations of taint analysis
is simple but powerful.
Figure out the attack surface and
make sure the tainted input can never reach
what you are trying to protect.
Following this simple idea
will surely lead to more secure code.
But if you are not sure,
you can always give a taint-checking tool a try.
