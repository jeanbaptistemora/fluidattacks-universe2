= The infinite monkey fuzzer

In our [inner]#link:../fuzzy-bugs-online/[last entry]#,
we argued that fuzzing is both ``dumb'' and surprising.
In this article,
we'll continue exploring the possibilities of fuzzing.
This time though, we'll focus on
desktop application fuzzing,
specifically +UNIX+ applications written in +C+.

When developing in +C+,
you usually have to handle memory issues yourself.
This makes your program very fast
compared to languages like +Java+.
But at the same time
this can lead to numerous kinds of memory-access errors
v.g. heap and stack overflows.<<r1 ,^[1]^>>

== The woes of fuzzing

Recall that in our last article
we ran a very simple-minded kind of fuzzing:
give the fuzzer a list of inputs
and it will invoke the program with each of those inputs one at a time.
Since the list was very generic,
only the most trivial inputs were successful;
because it was not random at all,
there could be no surprises.

Another type of fuzzing could be
by injecting random inputs:
this could lead nowhere,
but it could show surprises,
as we discussed in our last entry.
Some go as far as saying that
link:https://blog.hboeck.de/archives/868-How-Heartbleed-couldve-been-found.html[Heartbleed could have been found with fuzzing].

But blind, random fuzzing is usually very shallow,
as was our attempted +SQL+ injection fuzzing.
Such methods are
``very unlikely to reach certain code paths
in the tested code''
Amongst the attempts at solving this problem
we can count:

* corpus distillation
* program flow analysis
* [inner]#link:../symbolic-execution-mortals/[symbolic execution]#, and
* static analysis.

However, while these methods appear to be very promising,
they tend to be impractical in real use.<<r2 ,^[2]^>>

== Down the Rabbit-Hole

link:http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/[American Fuzzy Lop (+AFL+)]
is a 'security-oriented brute-force fuzzer'
that tries to solve these issues with
'compile-time instrumentation' and 'genetic algorithms'.
But what the heck does all that mean?

A different approach would be
to make your fuzzer aware of the file format
taken by the tested program as input,
but this is rather inconvenient.
Instead, what +AFL+ does is, in plain words:

. take the source code of your app,
. compile it in a ``tricked'' way,
. run it with a good input and then
. iteratively modifying that input until you get an error.

For example, you might start +AFL+
on a program with an image of a rabbit as input.
Then the fuzzer modifies the image
a little piece at a time,
feeding it back to the tested program
until a hang or crash or other unexpected behavior happens.
Here you can see the sequence of images
fed into the tested program:

image::afl-fuzz-logo.gif["Fuzzed image inputs"]

== Running AFL

The American Fuzzy Lop is primarily a white-box testing tool,
so you must have the code for the app you want to test.
This is because +AFL+ needs to trick the app during compilation
in a process known as 'instrumentation'
so that it will allow the fuzzing process.
Thus you must compile using the included +afl-gcc+,
which is a modified version of the +GNU Compiler Collection+.

Then you should run your program with a valid, simple input:
+*program* input+.
If that goes well,
put that input file in a folder by itself.
I'll call it +in+.
Make another empty one for the results called +out+.
I'm assuming everything lives in the folder you are in right now.
Now you're ready to run +AFL+:

.Invoking the AFL fuzzer
[source,bash]
----
$ afl-fuzz -i in -o out program input @@
----

If everything went right, then you should see this:

.+AFL+ main interface
image::scr-afl-single-677x462.png["+AFL+ interface screenshot"]

Not very exciting, huh?
But as long as the +total paths+ indicator
is not stuck at 1, trust me, it's doing its thing.
+AFL+ will continue running until you tell it to
stop by hitting +<Ctrl-C>+.

When +last uniq crash+ or +last uniq hang+
stops saying ``none seen yet'',
you have made your program crash.
+AFL+ will save the inputs that provoked
the crash in the output folder we specified.

== Fuzzing libpng - details

+libpng+ is the official PNG reference library.
If you've ever seen an image in a web browser,
you've been using it indirectly.
It is used by +ghostscript+, +imagemagick+,
amongst many others.

As listed in its link:http://libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html[website],
it has had many bugs throughout its history.
We're interested in showing here how to find
link:http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8126[CVE-2015-8126]
which is a potential pointer overflow/underflow,
using +American Fuzzy Lop+
(which is how they found it
in the first place).

As it turns out,
it's not just a matter of
following the generic instructions above,
because if you do:

* the fuzzer will tell you
that the execution speed is slow
* a single instance of +afl-fuzz+
on a single core
will take a long time
* it won't find anything anyway,
because you need to patch +libpng+
* you need the right executable using +libpng+,
namely +optipng+

So, let's fix all these issues in the right order.
Here the credit is due to
link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/afl-users/4p3UmkpWWR0[Jakub Wilk]
who originally reported the bug.

. Apply
link:https://github.com/mirrorer/afl/blob/master/experimental/libpng_no_checksum/libpng-nocrc.patch[this patch]
to +pngrutil.c+ to +libpng-1.5.1+

. You need to instrument +libpng+ and +optipng-0.7.5+
using +afl-clang+ instead of the default +afl-gcc+.
Also install +libpng+ with +make clean all+
so it doesn't conflict with
your local installation
(which you most certainly have):
+
[source,make]
----
CC="afl-clang" CXX="afl-clang++" ./configure --disable-shared
make clean all
CC="afl-clang" CXX="afl-clang++" ./configure -without-system-libpng
make install
----

. To use all +n+ cores available to you,
create +n+ subdirectories in your output folder.
Run +afl-fuzz+ as before
with the option +-M folder1+ for the first core,
and +-S folderx+ for the rest.
Example with two cores:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ afl-fuzz -i in -o out -M core0 program input @@
$ afl-fuzz -i in -o out -S core1 program input @@
----

. Use a small +PNG+ file as input,
such as +not_kitty.png+ included in +AFL+.

. You can further speed up the process by ``cheating''
using a previously produced set of fuzzed images available
link:http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Flcamtuf.coredump.cx%2Fafl%2Fdemo%2Fafl_testcases.tgz&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEbj_y8FGgGRqdx4zOXWtAdaUA-bw[here].
Put these images in your +out+ folder.

Following the steps above,
here is the optimised +afl-fuzz+ running
on +libpng+ and +optipng+ with 4 cores:

.+AFL+ succesful run (link:anim-afl-4-cores.gif[click] to view larger)
image::anim-afl-4-cores.gif["AFL running on 4 cores", width=800,link="anim-afl-4-cores.gif"]

We see that,
within a few minutes,
the slave processes
have made the app hang,
but not the master.
The reason falls out of the scope of the article,
though; see
link:http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/technical_details.txt[+AFL+ performance tips].

== So what's the bug?

OK, we made the application hang.
So what?
It's not up to me to explain it,
but I will quote the essentials
from the pros
for the sake of completeness.

Back then, if you called +optipng+
with this link:https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?att=1;bug=787647;filename=crash.png;msg=3[file]
you'd crash it:

....
$ optipng crash.png
** Processing: crash.png
Warning: Can't read the input file or unexpected end of file
24x32 pixels, 1 bit/pixel, 4 colors in palette, interlaced
optipng: opngreduc.c:697: opng_reduce_palette_bits:
Assertion `src_bit_depth == dest_bit_depth' failed.
Aborted
....

The problem happens when
an application uses low-bit-depth palette mapped +PNG+ data
because when returning the palette
it has to be copied back to the +OS+-specific format
in a potentially vulnerable way:

[source,c]
----
    for (i=0; i<num_palette; ++i) {
        bmh.palette[i][0] = tmp_palette[i].red;
        bmh.palette[i][1] = tmp_palette[i].green;
        bmh.palette[i][2] = tmp_palette[i].blue;
    }
----

And here's the problem with that code:

``This is valid code according to the +PNG+ spec
because +num_palette+ cannot be more than 16 in a valid +PNG+.
Unfortunately in +libpng+ before the fix
+num_palette+ can be up to 256
with an appropriately modified +PNG+.
The overwrite above is at the high address end of +bmh+,
so it overwrites up the stack (on a typical machine) into the call frame and
pretty much gives an attacker complete control over the application program.''
<<r3, ^[3]^>>

This bug was actually found
using +AFL+ at the time on
link:https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=787647[+Debian Sid+],
as has been the case for
many other real-world +C+ applications,
even high-profile ones like
+bash+, the +X server+, +curl+, and the +Linux kernel+.
See +AFL+'s
link:http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/#bugs[``bug-o-rama trophy case''].

''''

So there you have it:
as promised, a more in-depth follow-up
to our [inner]#link:../fuzzy-bugs-online/[initial invitation to fuzzing]#.
According to +AFL+'s father,
this technique is both
very powerful and underappreciated:

[quote,Michal Zalewski]
Fuzzing is one of the most powerful and proven strategies for
identifying security issues in real-world software;
it is responsible for the vast majority of
remote code execution and privilege escalation bugs
found to date in security-critical software.<<r2, ^[2]^>>

Hopefully this article has helped to
spark some curiosity and
convince you a little of that.
