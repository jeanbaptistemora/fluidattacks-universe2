:description: We believe that we have a great developed capacity, evidenced in this crisis, to work 100% remotely and safely. In this post, we give an overview of what our technological architecture and our way of operation are, that allow us to have that capacity, and briefly explain our security controls.

= 100% Ready for Remote Work

Back in *2009*, `Fluid Attacks` experienced
one of the most significant cultural changes in its history:
selling all its offices, furniture and belongings,
and keeping only its laptops.
At that time, we discovered the potential of the cloud,
migrated all our systems to it, sold our technical room, its servers, `UPS`,
backup tape systems, everything.

All the people were authorized to work from home,
keeping only a new and small office
with a single workstation for administrative tasks,
and a meeting room for eventual face-to-face meetings.

The leading providers at that time were `Amazon`, for all the infrastructure,
and `Google`, for the entire collaboration suite.
With these two elements,
plus a `VPN` system customized by us in the `Amazon` infrastructure,
we were able in less than a month to operate fully distributed
for a team of approximately *50* people,
after almost eight years working a few meters away.

The first six months of this exercise were the best of that time,
productivity increased, distractions were minimized,
and staff reported comfort and happiness.
Costs, even considering the subsidy of teleworking
given to all talents for the Internet and other expenses, were minimal.
The company's flexibility to grow was high,
as the purchase of a laptop was sufficient.
However, after those six months, the company was different.

Making a company grow by teleworking means that
communication that was once informal now becomes formal.
You stop seeing your colleagues' faces,
and the sense of urgency is not remotely conveyed.
The induction and training that used to come naturally
now need to be formally defined.
And the integrations that used to emerge organically must now be decreed.

During all this time,
we organized face-to-face meetings on Fridays from *5 PM* to *6 PM*,
in which we watched films, gave technical talks,
updated the company on new colleagues,
carried out integration activities in different places, etc.
However, these spaces could never achieve the closeness
that sharing a physical space allows.
Besides that, what used to be an agile and fast company,
fast in implementing changes, became slow and pachydermic.

So, we decided to return to a traditional face-to-face working mode
and buy back an office,
but keep teleworking as a contingency mechanism,
either for individual exceptions or for general company eventualities.
Holding this position enabled,
indicated to us that from the technological point of view,
the systems facilitating telework should remain:
laptop for all, dedicated internet channels or `VPNs` with the clients,
and central systems (`IaaS` and `PaaS`) in the cloud.
Besides, an automatic time control system (`Time Doctor`)
that would facilitate the identification
of moments of low productivity or low use,
and a central active directory, as a service,
that would allow the remote management
of equipment that required support or backup (`JumpCloud`).

In addition to all these systems, which are still in place today,
the organization and technology have been evolving
and providing us with more possibilities.
In the past, we used `Yubico` tokens;
these assigned to each employee reinforced the security of the `VPNs`,
generated `OTP` keys with less exposure time,
and also did not require a battery.
However, provisioning a token
is more complicated in non-presential environments.
For this reason, today, our security scheme is reinforced
by an identity and authentication management tool such as `Okta`.
With it, all employees must enter a user before entering any system,
enter a passphrase (we do not recommend passwords),
and also confirm through push notification by an out-of-band channel (`OOB`)
that he or she is authenticating.
This must be done from his or her cell phone,
which, if it has a biometric device,
forces him or her to present facial or fingerprint authentication.
Only then does he or she have access to a portal
where he or she can enter all the organization's systems.
From this portal, a record is kept of who accessed what,
and the system-system keys are rotated without impacting the users.

It only remains to mention that our approach to the product
since this decade makes us operate on a system that,
consistent with our convictions, is totally in the cloud
and in the most outsourced mode possible: `Gitlab SaaS` version.
For security and transparency,
all our developments are open to the public to be audited by anyone.
This implies that they are available under `Open Source` license,
enabling us with this the most robust of the versions: `Ultimate`.
Through `Gitlab`, we do all the version management, issues management,
configuration management, change coordination, in all our systems,
including web pages and servers.

In this sense, the current pandemic by `COVID-19`
has been for us nothing more than a sad moment for humanity,
for many people who are losing their loved ones,
and for others who are seeing their way of life affected.
For us, from no perspective
has it represented a technological or operational challenge.
Everything has been in place for more than ten years
to operate normally in the face of this difficult time.

The office is now empty,
with only chairs and large screens
arranged for the comfort and ergonomics of an absent talent.
There is no information, documents, or objects of value there,
except for some beautiful plants that harmonize and embellish the place,
and that, with some disquiet, we do not know how we will find when we return.
