= Digression to Regression

After our [inner]#link:../tags/risk[risk quantification series]#,
it should come as no surprise
that we like numbers and measuring.
However, when confronted with the question,
"Why do you need to translate code into vectors?"
I'm not sure what to say.

Almost all machine learning algorithms in abstract,
and the concrete tools and libraries
from the +Python+ data science toolset
(+Numpy+, +Pandas+, +Keras+)
_expect_ the features and targets to be real-valued.
They rely on concepts such as _distance_,
_error_, and _cost functions_,
and they attempt to minimize the latter
by adjusting their inner parameters.
All of these concepts are inherently mathematical.


Out of all of these algorithms,
the easiest to understand well
is perhaps the simple linear regression.
So, let’s start with that.
_Regression_ is a fundamentally different kind of task
from the ones we have
[inner]#link:../crash-course-machine-learning/[discussed the most in the series]#,
which are classification and clustering tasks.
Regression aims to predict a number taken from a continuum
instead of answering _"yes"_ or _"no"_
or to tell from which group
an input most likely belongs.

The situation is this:
we have two variables that appear to be linearly related,
and we would like a model that generalizes that relationship.
Simple linear regression is used
for many interesting purposes,
such as determining:

* he relationship between the sales price of an asset vs. its age,
i.e., understanding depreciation

* the fuel efficiency of a vehicle: fuel consumption vs. distance covered

* the effectiveness of advertising: money spent on ads vs. revenue

* indirectly measuring physical quantities,
such as speed or acceleration

In the first three examples above,
it could be argued
that there are other variables at play,
that the relationship might not be necessarily linear, etc.
But in the last case,
and under lab-controlled conditions,
it is true that the position _x_
of an object that moves at *constant* speed _v_
after a time _t_ departing from an initial position _i_
is given by _x = vt + i_.
Suppose we want to know the speed _v_
using only a ruler and a watch.
If measurements were perfect,
we would only need two,
for we have two unknowns: _v_ and _i_.
However, in reality, measurements are not perfect,
so we need to take several measurements,
and sort of "average them out"
via fitting a line, i.e., the regression.
We can take several measurements of _x_ and _t_,
which we might register in a table like this:

.Position vs. time, first few observations
image::table.png[Position vs time table]

This doesn't say as much as a plot:

.This shows positive correlation
image::data.png[Position vs time table scatterplot]

Here we see there is a clear linear relationship,
but no single line would perfectly fit all points.
The goal in linear regression
is to find the line that _best_ fits the points.
But what is the "best" fit?
There are several choices,
and each of those choices would represent a different model.
The standard in linear regression
is to minimize the sum of the squares of the errors for each observation.
What? Each choice of _v_ and _i_ would produce,
for each value of _t_, a corresponding value for _x_,
which may be close or far from the actual observation.
The difference between these two is called a residual.
But we don’t care about each individual residual,
we want only to make them small overall.
So we add them all, but before that,
we square them in order to avoid the possibility
that due to the signs,
they might end up adding to something close to +0+.
This is, in fact, the cost function for this particular algorithm:
different techniques come with different cost functions
and different ways to minimize them.

In simple linear regression,
the expression for the cost function
is easy enough to solve with pen and paper.
In other algorithms,
hill-climbing and gradient descent techniques
are taken from optimization.
Even simple brute force (trial and error) might be used,
as long as the cost function is minimized.

Instead of implementing simple linear regression in pure +Python+,
which could be done,
let this serve as an excuse to present
the general machine learning flow.
The tool of choice to perform
"traditional" machine learning and
data analysis in Python, i.e.
everything but neural networks,
will be link:https://scikit-learn.org/[scikit-learn].
The flow to use this library is typically the same,
regardless of how sophisticated the chosen model:

* Create an illustration of the model:

.Creating a linear regressor in scikit
[source,python]
----
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression(fit_intercept=True)
----

* Train (fit) with the data
[source,python]
----
model.fit(t, x)
----

Assuming that _t_ and _x_ are +NumPy+ arrays
(a more mathematically appropriate extension of lists)
holding the time and position variables, respectively.

* Make predictions
[source,python]
----
import numpy as np
time = np.linspace(0, 31, 1000).reshape(-1,1)
xfit = model.predict(time)
----
Create a new array holding a thousand
evenly spread values for time, and then
use the trained model to predict their
corresponding values in the independent variable.

* Assess model performance
[source,python]
----
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.scatter(t, x, alpha=0.7)
plt.plot(time, xfit, 'red')
----

.Regression line fits the data relatively well
image::regression.png[Data + regression line]

In the case of simple linear regression,
it is possible to _see_ how well the model performed (see above).
Quantitatively, we can use the _R^2^_ metric:

[source,python]
----
>>> model.score(t, x)
0.9531426066695182
----

The closer this value is to _1_,
the better the fit, and hence, the regression.

That is, in a nutshell, how to
make, train and draw predictions from
machine learning algorithms in +scikit+,
with a few subtle changes from one to the next,
such as:

* Usually, one splits the data into training,
validation and testing sets.
However, the expected format remains the same.
The _features_ or _predictors_
(_t_ above, but usually _x_)
need to be an array of vectors,
and the _targets_ or _labels_ (usually _y_)
a simple list or +1D+ array.

* The validation and testing are performed
in different ways according to the task,
since plotting them and getting a single evaluating number
as above is not always feasible.

Perhaps this helps to explain why you need to translate code into vectors.
More later, on why, and how to turn natural language
and code into vectors so that they might be used by standard ML techniques.
