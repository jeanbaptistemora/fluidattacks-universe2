:description: In this blog, we will show you the basics of Purple teams. We will address some topics such as what they are, what they are not, when they are needed, what they do, what an organization should not do and possible ways to implement them successfully in an organization.

= Do we need a Purple team?

We can interpret the Purple teams as a mixture
of Red or sword and Blue or shield teams in pentesting processes.
They are professional hackers
that simulate attacks and protect an organization.


== Notions

In cybersecurity, the organizations should understand the Purple teams
as a communication bridge
that allows Blue and Red teams to work together in a simulated cyberattack.
The main goal is to help improve organization security posture.
In other words, they can help coordinate
and increase the effectiveness of both teams.
We have to be careful with the implementation and execution
of a Purple team  <<r1, ^[1]^>>, as Julian Arango <<r6, ^[2]^>> says:

.A Conflict of Interest?
[quote]
  " In some cases,
  this interaction can propitiate malfunctions inside the organizations,
  especially when the affected parties are biased by their interest
  and can manipulate or conduct the results of a pentest.‚Äù


== What does a Purple team?

Some of the highlights are <<r2, ^[3]^>>:

. *Analyze*: They analyze the behavior
and interactions between the Red and Blue teams.
Along the process, they can generate recommendations, suggestions
and improvements for both parties.
In practice, if there are not link:../attack-no-announce/[well-defined cybersecurity objectives] <<r7, ^[4]^>>
and there are personal interests on the test outcome
is likely that link:../conflict-interest/[a conflict of interest] appears.
The organization can suffer conducted Pentest,
tampering of pentesting outcomes,
lack of blindspot detection <<r6, ^[5]^>>, among others.

. *Detection*: How can the Red team bypass the detection capabilities
of the Blue team.

. *Remedial actions*: They can suggest fixes to avoid vulnerabilities.

. *Transfer*: Ultimately deriving
maximum value from the exercise by applying the new
knowledge and ensuring strong defenses.

== When does an organization need Purple team?

Unfortunately, Red and Blue teams can get out of sync
with each other and have some cooperation issues.
Some common causes are <<r3, ^[6]^>>:

. *Bad politics*: Organizational politics does not encourage the flow
of information, they evaluate the success of the Red team for the amount
of failed controls from the Blue team,
and the success of the Blue team for the number of alerts.
Therefore the partners are not motivated to share information.

. *Slow feedback loop*: The information moves too slow between teams
or in some cases, does not even move.
There is poor communication between teams.

. *Mindset*: Each team works separately to obtain its objectives.
For instance, the Red team will enhance offensive exploit.
The Blue team will enhance defensive findings.
This mindset can damage the overall security system of an organization.

. *Arrogance*: The Red team thinks itself too elite
to share information with the Blue team.

. *Restricted*: The Red team
is pulled inside the organization and becomes restricted,
ultimately resulting in a catastrophic reduction in its effectiveness.

. *Bad design*: The Red team and Blue team are not designed
to interact with each other continuously,
as a matter of course, so lessons learned on each
side are effectively lost.

. *Separate efforts*: Information security management does not see
the Red and Blue team as part of the same work.
There is no shared metrics between them.

If your organization presents one of these illnesses is more likely
to think in a Purple team as a solution.
Rather than considering it as a separate group of people,
the organizations should consider it as
a help function between Red and Blue partners.

== What is not the solution?

Under any circumstance, it is recommended to create a separate group
of people who permanently carry out the intermediation between
the Red and Blue teams.
This measure would not solve the underlying problem,
which is to improve communication and collaboration between teams.

== So which are the possibles solutions?

We need to improve communication and cooperation between teams.
The following techniques can be used to enhance these two aspects.

. *Team engagement*: A third party analyzes
how the Red and Blue teams communicate and cooperate regularly.
Based on their behavior, the third-party makes recommendations.
This measure is momentary and finite.
The main goal of this technique is <<r4, ^[7]^>>:
to make the communication process smoother and to ease knowledge transfer.

. *Team exercise*: Someone monitors both teams in real-time
to see how they work.
The main goal of this technique is <<r5, ^[8]^>>:
to evaluate your security controls and ability
to detect attacks, compromise, lateral movement, command
and to control communications, and data exfiltration.
This technique enriches and validates the detection mechanisms used in situ
and helps to identify and reduce cyber attack paths.

. *Team meetings*: Periodically, Red and Blue teams meet
to share knowledge and give feedback about attacks and
defenses used in the pentest process.

== The benefit of appropriate implementation

It will create a better flow of information
between Red and Blue teams which means,
Red will learn how Blue is detecting and mitigating their offensives,
Blue will be able to know how Red is bypassing their defenses.
This loop of enhancing between the Red and Blue teams
improves the organization's security posture.

== Conclusion

A Purple team should be understood as a function
of Red and Blue teams,
a mixture of both sides of the same coin,
where the information can flow in an infinite loop of enhancing the abilities
of Red and Blue teams.
Under any circumstance should it be understood as a permanent group
of people who will mediate the relationship between the Red and Blue team.
