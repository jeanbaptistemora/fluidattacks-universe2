:description: Web security nowadays is a matter of concern. Web applications can be attacked by injecting malicious code within the user input so it is important to take measures to avoid this kind of attacks. In this article we explain how to avoid one of the most common attacks: Cross Site Scripting (XSS).

= Dude, where's my XSS protection?

Web application security is a major concern nowadays. You have to make sure
your application is secure, especially if you have a lot of users. There are
many controls a developer can implement to attempt to make the site safer. Or
so they think. The fun of hacking is looking for a different way to get things
done. There are many reasons to why these developers are mistaken, in this
article we will be talking about a very common XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
"solution" that all it really does is make the game that much more interesting.

XSS is a technique or an attack used to exploit vulnerabilities in which
malicious scripts are injected or inserted into what is believed to be a
trusted web site. These attacks can occur when data enters a web application
through an untrusted source, most frequently a web request, and that data is
included in dynamic content that is sent to a web user without being validated
for malicious content. The malicious content sent to the web browser is often
`JavaScript`, but may also include `HTML`, `Flash`,
or any other type of code that the browser may execute.
`XSS` based attacks most commonly include transmitting
private data, like cookies or other session information, to the attacker,
redirecting the victim to web content controlled by the attacker, or performing
other malicious operations on the user's machine under the guise of the
vulnerable site (OWASP, 2016).

To explain a specific XSS prevention method and one of the ways we can bypass
this control we will be looking at a really cool challenge from our pals at
link:http://halls-of-valhalla.org/beta/challenges[Halls of Valhalla].

== Halls of Valhalla Challenge: XSS4

Our task here is to perform an XSS injection with alert(1). The JavaScript
alert(1) method generates a pop up alert window with 1 as a the alert message.

.Challenge XSS4 on halls-of-valhalla.org

In this challenge we are presented with an input in which we can submit a
message with a title, very much like a forum. The key is that we are also given
the source code for the function that displays my message. This function is
written in PHP. First we need to go through the source code and understand what
it is doing. Once we have done this we can look for possible vulnerabilities.

.Display message function source code
image::image2.png[message]

From the code we see a conditional check. The if statement checks the return
value of the method ISSET(param) which determines if the param is set and is
not NULL. Inside the conditional check we see three very similar instructions
followed by an echo. The three similar instructions all take one of the input
fields from the form, pass it through the strip_tags() method and assign the
new value to a variable. The echo message then echoes or prints on screen an
`HTML` <div> tag. The tag has some basic attributes and one of the attributes
used is the title variable with my input after strip_tags. So the echo
instruction displays the message along side the user name.

If we try the basic injection, "<script>alert(1)</script>", we can see that the
strip_tags() method removes everything starting at "<" and ending in ">". The
echoed message would then be "alert(1)" which is useless without the correct
script tags.

We said before that an XSS can occur when data enters a web application
through a web request, and that data is included in dynamic content that is
sent to a web user without being validated for malicious content. That is
pretty much exactly what we have here with one small exception. Our input IS
validated for malicious content, strip_tags() is applied to all my input
strings. So if we can find a way to bypass that validation, we can then exploit
the XSS vulnerability.

OWASP provides very helpful and complete documentation on various security
topics. For attacks it provides great cheat sheets that can guide you in the
Ethical Hacking process.
Here is link:https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page[TheirOfficial Homepage]
for a look into the many topics and resources `OWASP` offers.

After further research on filter evasion, we can find that the strip_tags()
method has a common and well known vulnerability. Since the method needs to
identify the "<" and ">" symbols in order to know what to delete, we need to
inject our script without the use of these symbols.

.Can you say XSS
image::image3.png[xss]

Note that in the echo message, one of the input strings, $title, is used inside
the actual `HTML` tag. This gives us a possible injection. We know we can't add
any tags, but no one has said anything about adding attributes. We can add an
event as an attribute and in that event call our JavaScript alert code. The
best way to do this is through the "onmouseover" event. This attribute sets
of an event when the mouse pointer is moved onto an element. So what we need to
do is inject our JavaScript alert as the event.

Note that the `HTML` tag puts single quotes " ' " before and after the $title
input. Hence we need to close the first " ' " in order to be able to add an
other attribute. We can't forget about the closing single quote, when adding
the attribute we need to leave the quotes open in order to use the single quote
added by the `HTML` tag and therefore maintain a valid syntax.

.Event: onmouseover='alert(1)'
image::image4.png[event]

Know that we have successfully posted our message containing the injection,
all we need to do to test it out is trigger the onmouseover event.

.There goes your XSS protection
image::image5.png[xss-protection]

Once we place the mouse pointer over our message we can see we get the alert 1
pop up.

There are many filters you can use to validate your website's input and reduce
the chances of a successful XSS injection. If you only use one filter there is
a very high probability that an attacker will be able to find a way around your
control. There are many functions in different programming languages which
implement not only one but many different filters to validate the user input.
If you are passionate about programming, you can easily do some basic
research and find different functions you can call in order to make one big and
complete XSS filter.
