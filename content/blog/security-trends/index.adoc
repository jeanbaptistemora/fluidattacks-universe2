= Security in trends

Nowadays technology keeps evolving,
day after day new tools, approaches, and trends will come out
and it's our duty to keep up with these changes,
to adapt to new technologies and apply all our knowledge and abilities
to *Find all the vulnerabilities and report them as soon as possible*.

In this article we will discuss some of the main
technology trends in 2019,
the cybersecurity risks that these trends may carry out,
and the security panorama in the next years
on these fields.

== Internet of Things

With the spread of +IoT+ (Internet of Things) technologies,
everyday more devices are exposed to the Internet,
but are not necessarily secured.
+IoT+ devices provide additional entry points for attackers,
giving them a whole repertoir of mechanisms
to compromise confidential information.

According to Bank Info Security <<r1, ^[1]^>>,
attackers continue targeting the same +IoT+ flaws,
reported and disclosed +3+ years ago.
+IoT+ malwares such as link:https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/mirai-botnet/[Mirai]
keep growing, escalating and mutating.
Your mobile, webcam, router or even your printer can be a target.
And these attacks are not particularly difficult to perform,
you can even find link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JFP_gUIZZY[Youtube tutorials] about it.

{sp} +
If you are part of the industry,
you cannot feel safe either,
since +PLCs+, +SCADA+ systems, smart sensors and drives
are also +IoT+ devices that can be compromised
as a result of a +Mirai Botnet+ attack.
This scene may look discouraging,
even more if we consider that in the next years,
the amount of +IoT+ devices will increase considerably.
But we can mitigate some risks from now,
by applying a system hardening,
something as simple as changing the default credentials,
and using link:../requiem-password/[secure passwords],
could prevent an +IoT+ attack.

== Companies in the Cloud

Most of the companies are now migrating to the cloud.
The advantages of Infrastructure as Code (+IaC+) are clear:
maintainability, scalability, pricing, among others.
With cloud computing service providers like
link:https://aws.amazon.com/[Amazon Web Services],
link:https://www.digitalocean.com/[Digital Ocean] or
link:https://azure.microsoft.com/es-es/[Microsoft Azure]
with large dedicated teams maintaining their servers,
our small infrastructure team seem obsolete in comparison.
It's better to outsource this aspect to bigger companies
and stop worrying about physical infrastructure.
Well, this is not completely true.
We cannot disregard the security aspect,
the providers fulfilled their duty,
now we must fulfill ours.

{sp} +
According to Ben Morris from link:https://www.bishopfox.com/[+Bishop Fox+] <<r2, ^[2]^>>,
speaker of the link:https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-27/dc-27-index.html[Defcon Security Conference #27],
hundreds of thousands of +Amazon Elastic Block Storage+ (+EBS+),
have misconfigurations that led
to sensitive data leakages: passwords, authentication keys,
encryption keys, among others.

image::aws-alarm.png[AWS misconfigurations]

And it's even worse.
In 2018, more than +70+ million records
were leaked due to poorly configured +AWS S3+ buckets <<r3, ^[3]^>>.
The main causes of this kind of vulnerabilities
are again, the human factor:
the lack of knowledge, or the negligence
regarding the infrastructure settings
can directly impact your company.
A weak +AWS+ configuration can be detected using automated tools.
link:../../products/asserts/[Asserts], one of our products
can detect these flaws,
using the link:https://fluidattacks.com/asserts/fluidasserts.cloud.aws.cloudtrail/[AWS Cloudtrail module].
However another percentage of the leakages
were caused as a result of hardware vulnerabilities <<r4, ^[4]^>>
such as +Spectre+ <<r5, ^[5]^>>, +Meltdown+ <<r6, ^[6]^>> or +Foreshadow+ <<r7, ^[7]^>>,
that exploit vendor chips vulnerabilities
to gain access to shared memory pools on physical systems.
So it it important to keep updated
in both software and hardware to avoid these kind of attacks.

{sp} +
At +Fluid Attacks+ we have all our infrastructure as code.
We use link:https://aws.amazon.com/s3/[AWS S3]
as cloud computing service provider,
link:https://www.terraform.io/[terraform] and link:https://www.docker.com/[docker]
to configure and link:../../events/burn-the-datacenter/[regenerate our datacenter].
We apply infrastructure hardening by using link:https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/why-we-need-dynamic-secrets[ephemereal secrets]
in a serverless approach.
We take security very serious, since it's our value promise.

== Machine Learning

Machine Learning, Neural Networks
and Artificial Intelligence ,in general,
has demonstrated to have several applications,
and cybersecurity is not the exception.
This topic has been widely addressed on link:../tags/machine-learning/[several blog entries],
for this reason, I won't go any further,
instead I would like to resume +Fluid Attacks'+
panorama about Machine learning in the cybersecurity field.

{sp} +
At +Fluid Attacks+ we do not discourage
the use of automated tools in security tests,
we even have our own link:../../products/commands/[custom cyberweapon]
that we use in some of our tests.
However, a real security issue comes out
when only automated tools
are used to perform security tests,
since these tools can report false positives,
(for example, in the case of neural networks,
some inputs can link:../fool-machine/[fool] the entire algorithm)
and do not replace human malice
to correlate vulnerabilities and link:../importance-pentesting/[create more complex attack vectors].
We see the machine learning emerging technologies more as tools
rather than the holy grail in cybersecurity that will link:../replaced-machines/[replace human hackers].
These tools can help our analysts to decide where to look first,
what portions of code may have vulnerabilities
and require further attention,
or which inputs may have not been properly sanitized.

== E-Commerce

Nowadays businesses usually have an online
alternative to purchase or sell products or services.
This have to be handled with extreme careful,
since most of the cyberattacks aim
to profit from these functionalities.
E-commerce attacks come in all kind of flavors and colors <<r8, ^[8]^>>:
phishing, identity theft, +DDOS+, credit card frauds, and more.

Most of them are based on social engineering.
Attacks that intend to trick the victim to perform actions
(click a link or provide confidential information)
that helps the attacker to gain control over the victim's transactions.

image::verizon-findings.svg[alt="Verizon findings", width=500]

According to Verizon,
on its anual _Data Breach Investigations Report_ <<r9, ^[9]^>>,
social engineering is the second
most used tactic to extract confidential information.
This is worrying,
because it doesn't matter how secure an application can be,
when the users are fooled to provide the access credentials.
This, of course, applies to electronic commerce as well.

One effective mitigation for social engineering,
is to train the people with talks and workshops,
teaching how to identify a phishing attack,
as well as some basic security measures to execute,
before providing personal information,
when purchasing online
(check the +URL+ and certificates,
suspect when the application requires _too much_ information, etc).

== Conclusions

As technology evolves,
cybersecurity should evolve as well.
This is the ideal scenario,
but often differs from the reality.
Cyberattacks become more complex
and solutions, patches and fixes take too much
to be developed and deployed.
On the bright side,
With the increasing trends in cyberattacks,
cybersecurity is gaining more relevance.
Each time more companies are investing
on security, developing tools
such as machine learning neural networks, and +AIs+,
and worrying about their applications
before exposing them to the Internet.
We totally agree with this belief,
security should be applied
on the entire Software Development Life Cycle (+SDLC+).
