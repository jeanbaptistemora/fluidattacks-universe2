:description: In this blog will be provided information on a Red Team exercise, for the reader to have a general context about what does a Red Team, also called Red Team exercise; we will mention the main strategy used in a Red Team exercise, also the benefits from this exercise to the customer.

= Red Team exercise

Red Team is referred to a group
that tries to access a system
through simulating a cyberattack,
but, in this exercise, a Red Team is like a soccer team,
because a soccer team has its offensive strategies
and every player has an important role;
this is the purpose of a Red Team:
use strategies, techniques, and tools to weaken a system.


== A brief concept of Red Team

Red Team is a group with knowledge in cybersecurity
that unlike the pentester,
they goes beyond than searching vulnerabilities and notified them.
a Red Team also simulates a real attack, assuming an adversary role.


== Divide and conquer

Red Team members have different link:https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ethical_hacking/ethical_hacking_skills.htm[hacking skills],
and rarely the members have the same skills;
this is because if an attack is structured and divided,
the members will focus on specific activities to achieve success,
thus, in a Red Team, you can find the following skills:

In consideration of the above,
we had a talk with Andres of +Fluid Attacks+,
when we asked him about the Red Team exercise
in +Fluid Attacks+, he said:
[role="fluid-qanda"]
  . First, the Red Team propose five hacking objetives,
  for example: escalate privileges, modify system files or install backdoor
  to do it, we use the kill chain strategy"

Please, take a look at this video from +Fox9+ about Red Team exercise:

== What is Kill Chain?

Kill Chain is a military term
to describe the steps to effect an attack;
one of its model is the +F2T2EA+
and include the following phases:<<r3, [1]>>

. *Find*: Identify a target.
Find a target within surveillance or reconnaissance data
or via intelligence means.

. *Fix*: Fix the target's location.
Obtain specific coordinates for the target either
from existing data or by collecting additional data.

. *Track*: Monitor the target's movement.
Keep track of the target until either a decision is made not to engage
the target or the target is successfully engaged.

. *Target*: Select an appropriate weapon or asset
to use on the target to create desired effects.
Apply command and control capabilities
to assess the value of the target and the availability
of appropriate weapons to engage it.

. *Engage*: Apply the weapon to the target.

. *Assess*: Evaluate the effects of the attack,
including any intelligence gathered at the location.

== Cyber Kill Chain

This term was adopted by link:https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/index.html[Lockheed Martin]
and his incident team to prevent cyber attacks.
Cyber Kill Chain has the next phases:

. *Reconnaissance* : Learning about the target using many techniques.

. *Weaponization* : Combining your vector of attack with a malicious
payload.

. *Delivery* : Actually transmitting the payload via some communications
vector.

. *Exploitation* : Taking advantage of some software or human weakness to
get your payload to run.

. *Installation* : The payload establishes the persistence of an
individual host.

. *Command & Control (C2*) : The malware calls home, providing attacker control.

. *Actions on Objectives* : The bad actor steals or does whatever he was
planning on doing.

== Cyber Kill Chain 3.0

This is an update of the cyber kill chain
for better defense by link:https://www.watchguard.com/es/wgrd-about/leadership/corey-nachreiner[Corey Nachreiner]
Watchguard Chief Technology Officer.

Cyber Kill Chain 3.0 has the next phases<<r1, [2]>>:

. Recon

. Delivery

. Exploitation

. Infection

. Command & Control - Lateral Movement & Pivoting

. Objective/Exfiltration.

As you can see, 3.0 version does not have big changes,
these changes were designed for better security defense,
but those are not the unique strategies,
as say link:https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2015/02/10/kill-chain-30-update-the-cyber-kill-chain-for-better-defense/[HelpNetSecurity]
[role="fluid-qanda"]
 . "Security professionals have differing opinions
 on the effectiveness of the kill chain as a defense model.
 Some love it, pointing out how several successful
 infosec teams use it, while others think it's lacking crucial details,
 and only covers a certain type of attacks.
 I think there is truth to both views,
 so I'd like to propose three simple steps to make the kill chain even better,
 let's call it +Kill Chain 3.0+."

For these reasons, Kill Chain is not the only option,
also, you can adapt your attack
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_strategy[strategy].

== Customer benefits

Then, what are the benefits on the client side?
it is so easy,
Because on a real attack scenario
the customer will not know how to proceed,
however if there is a simulation of cyberattack,
the Red Team will notify every weakness on the system or application
where the customer failed,
so the customer keep protected its information.

So, the customer can fix, build, design, and maximize the cybersecurity<<r4, [3]>>
and for this reason, the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_team_(computer_security)[Blue Team] exists.
In this post was not mentioned, but like Red Team,
Blue Team has its defensive estragies,
and we will go into that in greater detail on another post.

== Conclusions

As link:https://medium.com/@redteamwrangler/how-do-i-prepare-to-join-a-red-team-d74ffb5fdbe6[Medium.com]
say a Red Team member must have an offensive Mindset,
for this reason, "+CTFs+, wargames, or pen testing labs
are a great way to exercise offensive mindset"<<r5, [4]>>
and in +Fluid Attacks+, every new member,
train with hacking and programming challenges
to check and grade the level of offensive Mind.
