= Online Voting for a New President?

Near the end of this year,
there will be a new presidential election in the `US`.
From the Democratic side,
Biden seems to be leading link:https://www.npr.org/2020/06/17/877951588/2020-electoral-map-ratings-biden-has-an-edge-over-trump-with-5-months-to-go[according to some early ratings],
competing with Trump on the Republican side seeking reelection.
This election process may occur amid the link:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9[COVID-19] pandemic
that is currently affecting us. Thus,
considering that we aim to maintain safe distances to prevent contagion,
questions arise on how to carry out the voting processes.
Could it be somewhat more convenient
and more secure to perform such processes over the Internet?

A few days ago, the researchers Specter, of MIT,
and Halderman, of the University of Michigan,
link:https://internetpolicy.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/OmniBallot.pdf[published an article] that reports how an online election
could be affected by attackers without detection.
These authors made the first review
explicitly focused on link:https://democracylive.com/omniballot-online/[Democracy Live's `OmniBallot`] platform
used in different states on certain voting activities.
Using link:../reverse-engineering/[reverse engineering] to analyze platform security,
Specter and Halderman found that `OmniBallot` is vulnerable to specific attacks
that can mean alteration of votes or theft of personal data.
They also gave some recommendations
to take into account for the next elections.

=== OmniBallot

Current health risks have led some states to consider the Internet
as a means of running the coming elections.
Generally, the Internet has been used to allow specific vulnerable populations
or those not present in the country to participate in elections.
Tools such as the so-called `OmniBallot` have been used for these purposes.
`OmniBallot` is a web-based platform
that can serve for three modes of operations:
blank ballot delivery, ballot marking, and _online voting_.
Now, reportedly, it is going to be used for the first time
by Delaware, West Virginia, and New Jersey with larger groups of voters,
and on the riskier mode in relation to cyberattacks, the _online voting_.

Let's clarify each `OmniBallot's` mode of operation:

. _Online blank ballot delivery:_
The voter downloads her corresponding blank ballot, and it is printed,
manually marked, and physically returned to the election authorities.
. _Online ballot marking:_ The voter marks her ballot on the website
and then downloads it to print it and return it physically.
Some jurisdictions give the option to return it via fax or email.
. _Online ballot return (online voting):_ The voter marks her ballot
and transmits it to the authorities over the Internet
through a service of Democracy Live.
Among the `OmniBallot` customers and in comparison with the two previous modes,
this is the least used.

Following ethical and legal principles,
Specter and Halderman limited their analysis
to the publicly available parts of `OmniBallot`,
specifically the Delaware version.
Therefore, as a general description
of the `OmniBallot` architecture, they proposed the following:

[role="fluid-qanda"]
  . The web app runs in the browser and uses HTTPS to load files
  and call REST-like APIs from several domains.
  When voting online or marking a ballot,
  the app sends the voter's identity and ballot selections
  to Democracy Live services running in Amazon's cloud.
  The app runs JavaScript loaded from Amazon, Google, and Cloudflare,
  making all three companies (as well as Democracy Live itself)
  potential points of compromise for the election.

After having a clear understanding of the platform's architecture
and client-server interactions, the authors analyzed the risks
created when `OmniBallot` is used in each of the three modes mentioned above.
Before we talk about it, let's state the possible attackers or adversaries:

First, there are some adversaries with access to the voter's device.
These attackers could be system administrators, abusive partners,
or remote attackers that control certain malware,
and could modify `HTTP` or inject JavaScript
to alter the behavior of the web browser.
In second place are the attackers
with access to the server infrastructure of `OmniBallot`.
These adversaries could be, for example,
internal staff from Democracy Live or Amazon, and external attackers
ready to access and affect the systems involved.
In third place are the adversaries with control of third-party code.
This involves attackers who may have access to third-party software
and services which `OmniBallot` integrates,
such as Google Analytics, AngularJS, reCAPTCHA, and Fingerprint JS.
Also, customers load some libraries from Amazon, Cloudflare, and Google,
where there could also be malicious subjects
willing to modify the `OmniBallot` platform.

So, what could these attackers end up doing
in the different ways `OmniBallot` works?

=== OmniBallot risks

. _Online blank ballot delivery:_ We can start
with the fact that the attacker could manipulate the ballot design,
for example, swapping or removing candidates.
In a more difficult to detect manipulation, for instance,
an attacker could even change bar codes to alter the records
when tabulated by a scanner.
On the other hand, there may be attacks not directed at the ballot itself
but the ballot return instructions.
The attacker could make the ballot be sent to an inappropriate place,
after knowing the voter's site that is between the data
verified by OmniBallot at the start.
Additionally, the attacker could mail a different ballot
(following their preferences) to the appropriate place
employing the voter's data.

. _Online ballot marking:_ Here,
the attacker could know the voter's selection before the ballot's generation,
and from this, modify that particular ballot
to suppress the vote for a specific candidate.
Attacks may also cover the reordering of candidates
and the swapping of the barcodes linked to each of them.
In these online marking cases,
the attacker could also simply alter the voter’s marking
and select a different candidate.
And while some might notice the change,
many others would not detect the errors on their ballots
and return them as they are.

. _Online ballot return:_ `OmniBallot` does not use
the "end-to-end verifiability (link:https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.03778[E2E-V])" approach
for a secure remote voting protocol.
Computer scientists have been working on it for several decades,
and to some extent, it is the most recommended approach.
It "allows each voter to independently check
that their vote is correctly recorded and included in the election result."
`OmniBallot` uses a protocol in which no one can verify
that what the voters gave as a selection
is the same as what the officials received.
Hence the possibility of the attacker changing the votes without being noticed.
Finally, as a risk associated with all modes of operation,
there is the collection and storage of privacy-sensitive data,
including names, addresses, and dates.

=== Recommendations and conclusion

Apparently, Democracy Live's security controls are limited.
Following the authors' recommendations,
`OmniBallot's` online ballot return should be eliminated,
and the physical ballot return
should be improved on accessibility and efficiency.
Also, online marking should be offered only to voters
who have this mode as necessary to join the elections.
Moreover, officials should carry out risk-limiting audits (link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk-limiting_audit[RLAs])
to test at least in part the accuracy of the computers' work.
Additionally, Democracy Live could reduce risks
eliminating _unnecessary_ reliance on third parties
that may constitute multiple routes of attack.
And as a final tip related to some legal protections,
`OmniBallot` should have a posted privacy policy
informing voters of the limitations on the use of their data
by Democracy Live and third parties.
The fact is that such data should only be used for the election process.

The public examination of `OmniBallot`
by two supposedly independent security experts
is something of high value when its use
—due to a positive record in much smaller procedures—
is under consideration for the next presidential election.
In the end, they warn us that
with such high risks of election outcomes being altered without detection,
and without sufficient tools to mitigate those risks,
it is best that at no time should the use of `OmniBallot`
(or any similar voting platform)
become an entirely online voting process.

And maybe less so now that these results have been published.
