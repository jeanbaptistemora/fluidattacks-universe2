= Quantifying risk

One of the least understood parts of a vulnerability
is the _risk_ it poses to the target.
On the client side, it tends to get confused with impact
and occurrence likelihood,
due to devices like the so-called ``risk matrix'',
which are supposed to help us
better understand risks:

.Risk ``matrices''. Via link:https://safestart.com/news/think-about-risk-adds-third-dimension-risk-matrix/[Safestart].

Discrete scales such as this have
the obvious disadvantage that they can't be added or
mathematically operated with in a sensible way;
they can be compared, but only crudely:
how do 3 lows and 4 mediums compare to 2 highs?
It is also hard to turn any of these into money terms.

While in other sectors, like insurance and banking,
risk is measured quantitatively and
thus converted into dollars and cents,
we are content with leaving the treatment
of security threats, basically, to chance,
by using these inaccurate scales for scoring risk.

But better methods exist in
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_science[actuarial science],
statistics, link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory[game theory],
and link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory[decision theory],
and they can be applied to measure cybersecurity risk.

Among the main reasons why
these methods are not widely accepted in the field are:

* Security breaches are rare,
so we can't possibly have enough data to analyze.
It wouldn't be ``statistically significant''.

* We do not see how we can measure risk, or even
understand what measuring is nor
what it is that we want to measure, nor how.

Before going into ground definitions,
let me show you what we can achieve
by applying quantitative methods to risk measurement:

.Loss Exceedance Curve <<r1, ^[1]^>>
image::loss-exceedance-curve.png[Loss Exceedance Curve]

This curve tells you the probability of losing any amount of money or more.
Thus from the graph, we can read that
the probability of losing $10 millions or more is around 40%,
but losing more than $100 is unlikely at around 15%.
You can enrich it with your _risk tolerance_
(what is the probability that you can accept to lose _n_ millions?)
and the _residual risk_ shows
how the risk is mitigated by applying some controls.
With this kind of tools, you can make
more informed decisions regarding your security investments.
If such a level of detail interests you, please read on.


== Measuring requires specification

First, we need to define _what_ we want to measure.
Is it possible to measure the impact of a breach
on my company's reputation?
Is reputation even measurable?
What makes some things measurable and others not?
Well, we need to be able to assign a number to it.
But also no measurement can represent reality or nature with 100% accuracy,
so there must be some uncertainty in measurement.
Uncertainty is _inherent_ to measurement.

In the lab, the length of an ant
could be reported as 1.2 cm plus or minus 0.1 cm,
which yields an _interval_:
the real size of the ant is somewhere between 1.1 and 1.3 cm.
There might also be some error due to
random mistakes or improper use of the measuring device,
so we can assign a _confidence_ of, say, 90%, to this measurement.
Observations reduce the uncertainty in a quantitative way.
At first, we might have estimated the length of the ant
to be between, say, 0.5 and 3 centimeters, with 60% confidence.
After measurement, we have less uncertainty.

Thus, what we think is intangible or unmeasurable
could actually be measured.
Continuing with the reputation example,
this might be measured indirectly by the drop in sales,
or by the costs incurred in trying to repair the reputation damage.
Another possibility for measuring could be
_decomposing_ the problem into smaller ones.
For example, instead of trying to
directly estimate the cost of a security breach,
you might break it up into affectation to
confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
How many records could be stolen or wrongfully modified?
What is each of them worth?
For how long could our servers be out of service?
How much money would be lost per hour?

Furthermore, events like these
need to be time-framed.
It doesn't make much sense to ask
"how likely is it that our organization suffers a major data breach?"
because, given unlimited time and resources,
it is almost certain to happen.
Plus, we probably don't care if it were to happen eons from now.
We need to set a reasonable time frame, like a year.
Once we achieve a result such as

* There is a 40% chance of suffering a successful denial of service
lasting more than 8 hours in the next year.

* If such a denial of service happens,
there is a 90% chance the loss will be between $2 and $5 million.

We could indirectly compute what might happen in 2 or any number of years.

Finally, there is the issue of not having enough data to
perform measurements or estimations, or rather,
thinking we don't have enough data.
That is not the case or,
if it were, then the established qualitative methods
like assigning arbitrary names on a scale of 1 to 5,
are just as inappropriate or more,
actually introducing noise or error.


== Subjective probability

The ultimate goal will be
to perform a simulation of random events, also known as
[inner]#link:../monetizing-vulnerabilities/[Monte Carlo simulations]#.
This type of simulation runs many times on single events,
and their happening or not happening is based on a
link:https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/probabilitydistribution.asp[probability distribution],
and such distributions require parameters as input.
These parameters usually determine the location and shape of the curve.

.Some probability distributions

These parameters are to be estimated by experts,
just like they estimate risk on a scale from 1 to 5.
Just as imprecise, perhaps, but the math performed
with the distributions obtained from these parameters
sort of rights the wrong in the initial guess.
Actually, subjective probability estimation can be calibrated to
a point where it can be done consistently and accurately.

Even if the estimates are completely wrong,
the good thing is that they can be further refined by
a simple rule from basic probability theory:
[inner]#link:../updating-belief/[Bayes rule]#.
It involves the prior probabilities (i.e., our estimates or initial beliefs)
and the posterior probabilities,
the ones computed after observing a certain piece of evidence.

Without going into details,
which we will leave for the next articles,
it can be shown that, from five expert inputs,
including the probability of a successful
[inner]#link:../importance-pentesting/[penetration test]#,
and the probability of remotely exploitable vulnerabilities
when the pen test is positive, that in that case, the
probability of suffering a major data breach can go
from a prior of 1.24% goes up to a resounding 24%.
If the test is negative, it goes down to 1.01%.
This shows, by the way, the benefit of a proper pen test
regarding the value of information.

Later we will also discuss more advanced methods
based on Bayes rule such as
[inner]#link:../hit-miss/[iteratively adjusting distributions]#,
which allows making forecasts with very scarce data, and
decomposing probabilities with many conditions.

''''

This article merely pretended to be an introduction to
the whole slew of methods that exist in other fields
to estimate risk, uncertainty and the unknown,
but have not been adopted in the field of cybersecurity.
In [inner]#link:../tags/risk[upcoming articles]#,
we will show in more detail
how some of these methods work.
